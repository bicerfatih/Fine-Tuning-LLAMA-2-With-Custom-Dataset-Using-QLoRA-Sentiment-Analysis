"1 Feb 2023
Caterpillar reported solid fourth-quarter results to close out 2022.",neutral
"The company’s machinery sales grew 21% year 
on year to $15.8 billion, thanks to stronger pricing and increased sales volume.",positive
"Retail sales (to end users) of 
machines were up 4% year on year globally, with North America (up 13% year on year) being the biggest 
contributor to growth in the quarter.",neutral
"Notably, retail was up sequentially compared with the third quarter of 2022, 
showing Caterpillar’s increased ability to meet the demand from end users.",positive
"That said, we’re not expecting much 
uplift from the dealer channel this year, as funding for infrastructure has still not flowed through to U.S. states.",positive
"In 
the quarter, Caterpillar noted that dealer inventories increased $700 million sequentially compared with the third 
quarter.",neutral
"If we compare this to the same period a year ago, we see a $800 million favorable impact on total sales.",neutral
We'd like to see this number cross over a billion dollars in the medium term.,neutral
"Management also provided adjusted profit margin guidance for various revenue scenarios for 2023, leading us to 
increase our fair value estimate to $208 from $196 previously.",positive
"The company’s guidance led us to tweak both our 
sales and operating margin assumptions in our cash flow model.",neutral
"We’re now expecting machinery sales growth of 
8% in 2023, while operating margins come in at nearly 15%.",positive
"Our forecast bakes in some impact from the U.S. 
infrastructure bill in late 2023.",negative
We expect most of the spending to flow through in 2024 and 2025.,positive
"We also 
increased our midcycle operating margin assumption slightly from 14.5% to 15% to account for increased sales 
volume over the next five years, in addition to favorable pricing for Caterpillar.",negative
"We still hold the view that supply 
chains won’t be fixed overnight, but we’re starting to see positive improvements on that front and think 
Caterpillar’s pricing power will allow the company to more than offset elevated manufacturing costs.",positive

"The company’s strategy focuses on employing operational excellence in its production process, expanding 
customer offerings, and providing value-added services to customers.",neutral
"Since 2014, Caterpillar has taken steps to 
reduce structural costs and its fixed asset base by implementing cost management initiatives and by either 
closing or consolidating numerous facilities, reducing its manufacturing floorspace considerably.",negative

condition, which has led to pent-up road construction demand.",negative

of oil since COVID-19 lows will encourage exploration and production companies to increase oil and gas capital 
expenditures, leading to increased sales of Caterpillar’s oil-well-servicing products.",neutral

"Dawit Woldemariam, Equity Analyst, 15 Feb 2023",neutral
"We're raising our fair value estimate to $209 per share from $208 previously, following Caterpillar's 10-K release.",positive
The change is mainly due to a lower net pension obligation in 2022 compared with 2021.,negative
"During Caterpillar’s fourth-quarter earnings, management provided guidance that led us to tweak both our sales 
and operating margin assumptions in our cash flow model.",neutral
"We’re now expecting machinery sales growth of 8% 
in 2023, while operating margins come in at nearly 15%.",positive
"We see stronger volume as a key driver, thanks to 
stronger U.S. nonresidential construction spending.",positive
"We expect sales to grow on average over 5% over the next five years, showing continued strength after a solid 
2022, when sales increased 17% year over year.",negative
"We believe mining markets will see limited upside, largely due to 
weaker expectations for commodity markets.",negative
"We project operating margins will peak at nearly 16% in 2025, 
before moderating to 15% in our midcycle year, as we believe Caterpillar will benefit from a better sales mix 
(sales of high-feature equipment) and higher-margin aftermarket sales.",positive
"Our discounted cash flow model is 
derived using Caterpillar’s industrial operations, excluding financial services.",neutral
"To account for the financial services 
subsidiary in our valuation, we make an enterprise value adjustment based on our assessment of the business’ 
value.",neutral
We think the largest revenue driver will be increased infrastructure spending in the United States.,neutral
"There is 
significant pent-up road construction demand, with many urban roads in relatively poor condition.",positive
"We also see 
low-hanging fruit in emerging economies to construct new roads and build out infrastructure to increase 
urbanization.",positive
"These factors will result in increased construction equipment revenue for Caterpillar, leading us to 
forecast over 5% average sales growth over the next five years.",negative
"In mining, we expect mining capital expenditures to be flat to down in our forecast.",negative
"In this environment, revenue 
will grow over the next five years by nearly 3% on average, reflecting higher aftermarket sales growth (due to 
increased machine utilization), offsetting weakness in new equipment purchases.",positive
"In our view, it’s unlikely that 
fixed-asset investment growth in China will stay at historical levels, meaning that the commodity price outlook 
will probably be softer than historical levels.",negative
"For energy and transportation, we forecast revenue to grow by nearly 5% through the next five years.",positive

these end markets globally, allowing Caterpillar to maintain its strong market share positions.",positive
"Looking across the heavy machinery industry, Caterpillar offers some of the most reliable, high-quality, and 
efficient products.",positive
"The company’s products can be categorized in three groups: lifecycle performance (medium- to 
heavy-duty applications), lifecycle value (light- to medium-duty applications), and utility (light-duty applications).",positive
These products provide a wide range of value propositions based on customer type.,negative
"Lifecycle performance 
customers value premium products (high specifications and features) that can withstand high utilization, operate 
around the clock, provide the lowest total cost of ownership, and ultimately measure machine success by cost

conditions that hold up on performance and quality.",negative

dealers, making it easy to understand what the total cost of a machine will be throughout its operating life.",positive
"We 
also believe the high cost of failure associated with switching away from Caterpillar’s products increases the 
likelihood of elevated projects costs, ultimately cutting into a customer’s profitability.",negative
"Furthermore, customers invest a significant amount of time and money into machinery, creating additional 
friction to switch products.",positive
"The purchase price of heavy machinery can run up into the hundreds of thousands 
(can get into the low-million-dollar range for new mining trucks), in addition to the time it takes machine 
operators to fully train on a machine to reach optimal productivity to complete projects on time.",positive
"Caterpillar also 
benefits from long product upgrade cycles, particularly in mining, where mining trucks have a useful life of over 
10 years.",positive

customers put is Caterpillar’s aftermarket offering.",neutral

network provide customers with aftermarket parts and reliable services to ensure their equipment operate 
efficiently, saving them from the headache of machine down-time and from having to search for parts

"Product safety issues include both customer 
injuries while operating Caterpillar machinery and injuries suffered by Caterpillar employees in the production of

"Carbon emissions regulation is increasingly a topic of discussion, but we think Caterpillar is already 
hedging against this risk through the development of next-generation products that reduce the carbon emissions 
of its products, namely its diesel-electric and electric drivetrains.",neutral
"Additionally, we think the effect from climate 
change initiatives will likely be incremental rather than immediate.",neutral
"In our view, the immediate threat is to new oil 
wells on federal lands, rather than the private lands that shale firms operate on.",positive

trend rating.",negative
"Both companies are commonly referenced as viable competitive threats to Caterpillar, but we see 
meaningful hurdles for both companies to reach global market success.",positive
"First, both Sany and Zoomlion do not 
possess the same level of product quality as Caterpillar and come up short in aftermarket services.",positive
"Caterpillar’s 
customers value products that offer high-quality, reliability, and a high number of features (classified as premium 
products), along with fast access to aftermarket parts and services.",positive
"Second, we agree that these companies have 
a considerable presence in their home market, China, but are relatively absent in global markets.",positive
"Looking at 
geographical sales mix, both companies produce most of their revenue in China.",positive
"Zoomlion produces 
approximately 10% of annual sales from overseas (5% global market share), while Sany generates around 30% of 
annual sales from overseas (7% global market share).",negative
"Third, Sany and Zoomlion’s dealer network isn’t as robust 
as Caterpillar’s dealer network; which covers every continent.",neutral
"We believe the lack of dealer coverage by Chinese 
competitors globally could lead to longer lead times for replacement parts and machinery maintenance for 
customers.",neutral
"Caterpillar is well positioned to fend off competition in emerging markets, with its SEM brand.",neutral
"Price-
sensitive customers can purchase simpler machines (not as many features) without compromising on the 
performance and quality that Caterpillar products are known for.",positive
"However, we believe Komatsu (based in Japan) is a more viable competitor to Caterpillar.",positive
"Komatsu produces 
construction, mining, and utility equipment mostly in Asia and the Americas (makes up about 80% of revenue).",positive
"The company holds the number two position in the global heavy machinery market behind Caterpillar at around 
10% market share.",negative
"That said, we think Caterpillar will maintain its lead over Komatsu based on its ability to 
continually bring the best products to market supported by an extensive support network provided by dealers.",positive
"Caterpillar’s future strategy revolves around selling multiple digital applications to enhance the customer’s 
experience.",neutral
Nearly all of Caterpillar’s new equipment manufactured today are connected machines.,positive
"This 
essentially means that all the components on a machine are connected to an electronic architecture, collecting 
valuable data around performance to drive insights.",neutral
"We think adoption of digital solutions by customers are still

costs, but we think it will take some time for Caterpillar to sell multiple digital applications to customers that lock 
them into the company’s ecosystem.",neutral

platform (the remaining assets can be retrofitted with digital connectivity).",negative

"Miners can start small by leveraging Cat MineStar to 
control a single mining truck remotely, eventually building up to operating a fully autonomous fleet of mining 
trucks.",negative
Autonomy has advanced in the mining industry for a few reasons.,positive
"First, mining operations afford the convenience 
of large open-pit mines for autonomous mining trucks to work unimpeded, utilizing efficient routes, along with 
the ability to work continuously around the clock (projects completed faster—boosting productivity by 30%).",positive
"Second, autonomy improves worker safety and reduces the number of on-the-job injuries.",neutral
"Third, miners can cut 
down on the high labor costs to encourage workers to come work in remote locations.",negative
"Despite the benefits of 
autonomy, the mining industry has yet to accelerate the adoption of autonomous mining trucks.",positive

number of fully autonomous mining trucks in operation today is still just a fraction of the installed base of 
traditional mining trucks (approximately 20,000 trucks from our estimates).",negative
"Risk and Uncertainty  Dawit Woldemariam, Equity Analyst, 1 Feb 2023",neutral

"We believe the most substantial risk to Caterpillar is declining investment in mining capital expenditures, given 
the firm's exposure to coal, iron ore, copper, and gold.",positive

by increased commodity demand, leading mining companies to increase production to meet demand from 
emerging markets.",positive

we expect.",positive
"In the near term, we expect the U.S. infrastructure deal and strong demand for new roads in emerging markets 
(increasing urbanization) to serve as tailwinds for Caterpillar.",positive
"However, during slow economic periods, investment 
in construction spending can quickly reverse, resulting in weaker capital returns for the company.",positive
"While we don’t think the pandemic presents as great a risk to oil demand today, we believe a potential 
slowdown in global economic activity could soften demand in the near term.",positive

Recent Analyst Notes
Caterpillar Reports Better-Than-Expected Third-Quarter Results, Thanks to Strong Pricing  Dawit 
Woldemariam,Equity Analyst,27 Oct 2022
Caterpillar’s stronger-than-expected results led us to increase our fair value estimate to $196 per share from 
$193.",positive
The company increased equipment sales 22% year on year to $14.2 billion.,neutral
"The key drivers were strong 
pricing and solid volume gains.",positive
Caterpillar has flexed pricing to mitigate supply chain constraints.,neutral
"Headwinds 
included material and freight costs, as well as manufacturing inefficiencies.",neutral
"We expect supply chain challenges 
to remain persistent throughout 2022 and likely into early 2023.On the volume side, Caterpillar noted dealer 
inventories increased $700 million in the quarter, resulting in a favorable $1 billion impact on total sales.",positive
"This 
remains near the low end of the typical range, but it is a positive sign compared with recent quarters.",positive
"Last 
quarter, the company reported inventories decreased $400 million.",negative
"Also, inventories were down $300 million in 
the third quarter of 2021.",negative
"Over time, we expect dealer sentiment to gradually pick up as U.S. infrastructure 
spending starts to flow down to various U.S. states in 2023 (many roads and bridges are in poor condition).In 
terms of demand, management noted average fleet ages are starting to increase, since customers have had to 
hold on to machines longer than usual.",negative
"Notably, Caterpillar’s backlog increased by $1.6 billion to $30 billion, 
showing strong demand in the pipeline.",positive
"We expect this to be a sales driver for the company as supply chains 
normalize.",neutral
We forecast sales during 2023-26 to grow over 5% on average.,negative
"Caterpillar’s stock price jumped nearly 
10% following the earnings report.",positive
"We believe the positive response was related to the stronger-than-expected 
adjusted EPS performance.",positive
This puts the stock approximately 10% above our $196 fair value estimate.,positive
"That said, 
we think the recent downward market volatility in markets may present long-term investors with a margin of 
safety in the stock.",neutral
"Supply Headwinds Persist in Caterpillar's Second Quarter, but Demand Remains Strong  Dawit 
Woldemariam,Equity Analyst,2 Aug 2022",positive
"We continue to remain positive on the demand story for Caterpillar, despite supply headwinds.",positive
"The company has 
been pressured by the chip shortage and higher manufacturing costs over the past year, challenging its ability to 
meet current demand.",positive
"However, we believe construction activity will continue to improve in the near term, giving 
us confidence that Caterpillar’s products will see strong demand from customers over our forecast.",positive
"In addition, 
we think the construction industry will benefit from increased U.S. infrastructure spending starting in 2023.",neutral
"Given 
this backdrop, we've raised our fair value estimate to $193 per share from $189.",positive
"In the second quarter, machinery 
sales increased 11% year on year to $13.5 billion, largely due to strong sales in North America, which grew 18% 
year on year.",positive
"The company’s machinery operating margins fell approximately 30 basis points from 2021 levels, 
given persistent cost inflation (materials and freight costs).",negative
"That said, management noted its ability to more than 
offset rising costs with strong price realization.",positive
"We expect Caterpillar to also raise prices in the back half of the 
year at a high-single-digit clip to stay ahead of inflation.",negative
"For 2022, we project over 15% sales growth for Morningstar Equity Company Report | Report as of 15 Feb 2023 21:20, UTC | Reporting Currency: USD | Trading Currency: USD | Exchange: NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. Page 21 of 28

Caterpillar held its investor day on May 17, where it reiterated its 2019 investor day targets for operating margins, 
free cash flow, and services.",positive
"Following the event, we raised our fair value estimate to $189 from $187 previously 
to reflect minor adjustments to our near-term margin expectations.",positive
"Recall that the company’s goal is to post a 
300-600 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margins compared with its historical performance (2010-
2016).",neutral
"Caterpillar has met this goal over the past few years, even in 2020 when the pandemic halted construction 
activity globally.",negative
"The company has been adept at reducing costs, restructuring its operations, and driving 
manufacturing efficiency.",positive
"Our midcycle profitability expectations remain unchanged, as we project 14.5% 
operating margins in 2026, reflecting the cyclicality of Caterpillar’s business.",neutral
"Caterpillar has successfully grown its 
services business, reaching $19 billion in sales (2021), up from $14 billion (2016).",positive
"In our view, the company can 
reach its $28 billion sales target for its services business by 2026 for two reasons.",neutral
"One, we think Caterpillar’s 
dealers will be able to use the technology architecture the company has built to drive greater parts and service 
revenue.",positive
"For example, more than one million machines (out of 1.9 million active construction machines) are 
connected to Caterpillar’s network, making it easier for dealers to know when maintenance is needed (makes 
dealers proactive).",positive
"Second, we expect to see Caterpillar lock in more customer value agreements at the point of 
sale, meaning it will handle all parts and service work for equipment (parts sales can make up more than double 
the machine purchase price).Management also highlighted its focus on sustainability as a key pillar to its strategy 
going forward.",positive
"We believe Caterpillar is committed to not only improve its own carbon footprint (through 
electrifying its machines) but also helping its customers become more sustainable in their operations.",positive

Overview
At the heart  of our valuation  system  is a detailed  projec-
tion of a company’s  future  cash  flows,  resulting  from  our 
analysts’  research.",positive
"Analysts  create  custom  industry  and 
company  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-
ally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or 
DCF,  modeling  templates.",neutral
"We use scenario  analysis,  inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical  tools  to augment  this process.",negative
"Moreover,  we 
think  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows 
presents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, 
high-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., 
mines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative 
earnings  over the next few years.",negative
"That said,  we don’t  dis-
miss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-
ing cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates.",positive
"We also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own 
challenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-
ated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss 
shortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these 
negatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our 
longterm approach.",positive
"Morningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-
lieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the 
future cash flows it can generate.",positive
"The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-
um to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in 
Morningstar  terminology.",positive
"Five-star  stocks  sell for the 
biggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.",positive
"Four key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our 
assessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate 
of the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that 
fair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.",positive
"This 
process  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-
ing.",neutral
1.,neutral
"Economic Moat
The concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not 
only in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term 
investment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of 
our fair value  estimates.",positive
"An economic  moat  is a structural 
feature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.",negative
"We define  economic  profits  as re-
turns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-
timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average 
cost of capital  (or WACC).",negative
"Without  a moat,  profits  are 
more  susceptible  to competition.",positive
"We have  identified  five 
sources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",positive
"Companies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are 
more  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns 
for at least  the next 10 years.",neutral
"Wide-moat  companies  are 
those  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess 
returns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more 
likely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.",positive
"The longer 
a firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic 
value.",positive
"We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will 
see their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",positive
"When  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess 
whether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, 
stemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, 
financial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.",negative
"In this con-
text, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its 
occurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a 
cumulative  or midcycle  basis.",negative
"If we deem  the probability 
of occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize 
the company as possessing an economic moat.",positive
"To assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts 
perform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.",neutral
"A firm’s 
moat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources 
of competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable 
where  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-
vantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when 
we see signs of deterioration.",negative
2.,neutral
"Estimated Fair Value
Combining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the 
firm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns 
on invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of 
capital.",positive
"Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-
ing are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a 
longer  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat 
firms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.",positive
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:,positive
"Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts

such  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in 
workingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.",positive

these  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, 
after  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.",positive
Stage II:,neutral
"Fade
The second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take 
the company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-
turn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to 
decline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.",positive
"During  the Stage  II 
period,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in 
lieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I.",negative
"The 
length  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of 
the company’s  economic  moat.",positive
"We forecast  this period  to 
last anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-
nomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-
panies).",positive
"During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using 
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on 
new invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years 
until  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.",negative
"The invest-
ment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-
til a perpetuity  value  is calculated.",positive
"In the case  of firms 
that do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal 
ROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-
able  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the 
second stage.",negative
Stage III:,neutral
"Perpetuity
Once  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-
petuity  formula.",neutral
"At perpetuity,  we assume  that any 
growth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither 
creates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.",positive
"Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash 
flows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present 
value  of expected  future  cash  flows.",positive
"Because  we are 
modeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash 
available  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we 
discount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a 
weighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-
ferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-
pected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value 
weights.",positive

"The long-term demand
fundamentals for CAT's equipment and services remain sound, despite periodic cyclical
downturns.",positive

such as accelerating demand for minerals used in clean energy technologies.",positive
"Additionally,
the company benefits from a formidable independent dealer network, and the retail and
wholesale financing provided by CAT Financial.",neutral
"CAT made considerable progress improving downside resilience through the operational and
financial rigor of its Operating & Execution model, as well as through the steady growth in
services revenue.",positive
"Consequently, we expect CAT to record an EBITA margin of at least 10% in
a cyclical downturn.",negative
"We estimate debt/EBITDA for the Machinery, Energy & Transportation
(ME&T) operations to be 1.0 time, which also tempers the risks from fluctuations in end-
market demand.",neutral

Credit strengths
»Highly competitive position in key markets
»Formidable independent global dealer network
»Demonstrated benefits from Operating & Execution model throughout the business cycle
»Longer-term demand underpinned by energy transition
»Good liquidity and prudent underwriting standards at CAT Financial
Credit challenges
»Cyclicality in end-markets can cause material fluctuations in financial performance
»Sizable annual funding needs at CAT Financial require unimpeded access to capital markets and substantial sources of committed
liquidity
Rating outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that favorable demand conditions for CAT's machinery and services will largely be sustained,
with some weakness developing in European markets in the course of 2023.",positive
"Given still healthy demand across most end-markets, CAT
will continue to be able to offset cost pressures with price actions.",positive
"Factors that could lead to an upgrade
»An enhancement in business position, including by profitably expanding ME&T services revenue; capitalizing on opportunities in
clean energy, carbon transition, and electrification trends; and, improving returns through successful execution of the Operating &
Execution model
»A step-up in EBITA margin throughout the business cycle, with expectations for the EBITA margin to approach 20% during strong
market conditions, and for the EBITA margin to be sustained above 13% during weak markets
»An improvement in CAT Financial's portfolio quality, with expectations for past dues below 3.0% during weak markets, and for debt/
equity to be maintained at around 7.25:1
Factors that could lead to a downgrade
»Erosion in the Operating & Execution disciplines and resulting decline in returns at various points in the business cycle, as evidenced
by the EBITA margin falling below 14% during strong market conditions, or below 10% when market conditions are weak
»A more aggressive financial strategy, with debt/EBITDA above 2.25 times during strong market conditions

Detailed credit considerations
Highly competitive product line-up and formidable independent global dealer network
CAT has the broadest and one of the most competitive line-ups of construction, mining and energy & transportation equipment in the
industry.",positive
CAT's machinery is essential to core segments of the global economy.,neutral
"Longer-term business prospects are favorable, in part
because of the increased need for minerals that are critical for a transition to lower emission energy generation and electrification of
end-use sectors.",neutral
CAT's formidable independent dealer network also provides CAT with a significant competitive advantage.,positive
"The company's dealers
have an extensive global presence with an excellent service quality reputation, are well capitalized, and built a sizable replacement and
services business that provides essential support during cyclical downturns.",positive

"Update to credit analysisMOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES
Expanding service offerings help increase margin and mitigate exposure to cyclicality in demand for new machinery
An important strategic pillar of CAT's focus on profitable growth is to significantly increase revenue from services.",positive
"Services have a
higher profit margin than original equipment and are less vulnerable to cyclical downturns.",negative
"Services also enhance the value proposition
of Caterpillar equipment for customers by improving asset utilization.",neutral
"CAT's goal is to expand ME&T services revenue to $28 billion by 2026, up from $14 billion in 2016.",neutral
"In 2022, services revenue grew to
$22 billion, or nearly 40% of total ME&T revenue.",positive
"The company aims to achieve greater services revenue by increasingly using Customer Value Agreements, the use of data derived from
connected assets (including through Prioritized Service Events), online dealer parts sales, and optimizing parts availability at its dealers.",positive
"More than 60% of new Caterpillar equipment was delivered with a Customer Value Agreement in 2022, and the company's global fleet
comprises 1.4 million connected assets.",positive
"Operating & Execution model supports stronger performance during cyclical downturns
We expect that CAT will record an EBITA margin of at least 10% in a cyclical downturn.",negative
"CAT's ability to contend with a cyclical
downturn improved significantly following the implementation of the Operating and Execution model.",neutral
"Cyclicality in CAT's end-markets
remains an ongoing risk and the resilience ensuing from the operational and financial rigor of the Operating & Execution model
provides critical support to CAT's credit profile.",neutral
CAT's financial performance at the start of the pandemic demonstrates the improved resilience.,neutral
"CAT's EBITA margin for ME&T was 12%
in 2020, when revenue declined 23% to $39 billion amid the pandemic-driven downturn.",neutral
"Prior to the implementation of the model,
CAT's EBITA margin had sometimes fallen to the mid-single digit range.",neutral
"For example, CAT's EBITA margin was 5.4% in 2016, when
ME&T revenue declined 19% to $36 billion.",neutral
"CAT revised its financial targets in accordance with the benefits that it expects from the implementation of the Operating & Execution
model.",neutral
"The company aims for a 300 to 600 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, regardless of the business cycle,
compared to its performance before the implementation of the Operating & Execution model.",neutral
"This would translate into an adjusted
operating profit margin (as defined by CAT) of 10% to 13% if revenue were to be around $42 billion, and 18% to 21%",neutral
"if revenue were
to be around $72 billion.",neutral
"Modest financial leverage mitigates financial stress during cyclical downturns
CAT's modest financial leverage at the ME&T operations also helps the company to contend with a cyclical downturn.",positive
"Debt/EBITDA
jumped to a still manageable 2.3 times during the pandemic in 2020, but fairly swiftly reversed to 1.3 times in 2021.",positive
"We project debt/
EBITDA to be 1.0 time at year-end 2023, in the absence of any debt funded acquisitions in services, technology or sustainability.",negative

The company's modest financial leverage at ME&T should also be considered in light of the considerably higher leverage and associated
funding needs of its finance subsidiary, CAT Financial.",positive
"Prudent management of CAT Financial
CAT's captive finance subsidiary (CAT Financial) has an essential role in the long-term competitiveness and commercial success of CAT.",positive
CAT Financial provides retail and wholesale financing to support customers and dealers of CAT products and services globally.,neutral
"CAT Financial manages its operations in a manner that supports the sale of equipment by ME&T, while preserving adequate levels
of financial discipline at the same time.",positive
"We calculate CAT Financial's ratio of debt/equity at 8.9 times as of March 31, 2023, virtually
unchanged from 12 months prior.",neutral
"Past due accounts as a percent of the total portfolio were 2.00%, slightly up from as low as 1.89%
at year-end 2022 but well below a peak of 4.13% in the first quarter of 2020.",negative
"Past due accounts remain historically low but could start
to increase somewhat amid a weakening in economies globally.",negative
"Allowance for credit losses was 1.27% of finance receivables, which
could also start to pick up if past due accounts were to increase.",negative
"CAT Financial's ratio of past due accounts and write-offs tend to be
moderately higher than those of peers during cyclical downturns.",negative
"Notwithstanding CAT Financial's asset quality and balanced leverage, we view the finance subsidiary's credit profile as “Ba” on a
stand-alone basis, in line with the median “Ba” credit profile for the US finance company sector.",neutral
"One of the key risks reflected in the
“Ba” stand-alone credit profile for CAT Financial, as well as for the broader finance company sector, is the dependence on access to
significant amounts of debt to fund the origination of new receivables.",positive
"As of March 31, the funding of CAT Financial's receivables
portfolio included $27.4 billion of debt, of which $12.1 billion matures in the next 12 months.",neutral
"Any disruption in the ability of CAT
Financial to access the debt markets could limit its ability to fund new retail and wholesale originations.",positive
"Nonetheless, the A2 rating of the debt that resides at CAT Financial is supported by the operating, financial and competitive strengths
of CAT, the critical strategic role that CAT Financial plays in supporting ME&T, a formal support agreement between CAT and CAT
Financial, and the liquidity of the consolidated group.",positive

"In addition, we expect free cash flow (after dividends) of ME&T to be approximately $4.0 billion in 2023, assuming changes in working
capital remain a substantial outflow but less than in 2022 when free cash flow was weighed down by a build-up of inventory to help
manage supply chain challenges.",positive
"Robust earnings growth also contributes to the increase in free cash flow in 2023 compared with free
cash flow of $2.6 billion last year.",positive
"CAT has three global credit facilities: a 364-day facility of $3.15 billion that expires in August 2023; a three-year facility of $2.73 billion

managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years.",negative
"Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and
outflow for our ME&T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10
percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2023 cash flow for our ME&T operations by
approximately $98 million.",negative
Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $89 million adverse impact on 2022 cash flow.,neutral

and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.",negative
"Since our policy
allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and
liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.",negative

rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances.",neutral

"We place great
emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers’ service support.",positive
"Although no one competitor is believed to
produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each
of our products.",negative
"We distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 43 located in the United States and 113
located outside the United States, serving 192 countries.",neutral

"B. Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.
Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than
20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.",positive
We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary.,positive
"For VIEs, we assess whether we are the
primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.",positive
"The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that
has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or
the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.",positive
See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.,neutral
"64Table of Contents
Cat Financial has end-user customers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary.",positive
"Our maximum exposure to loss
from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided.",negative

was evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit
losses.",neutral
We include shipping and handling costs in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1.,neutral

"The
value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 65 percent and 60 percent of total inventories at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.",neutral
"If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $3,321 million and $2,599 million higher than reported at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",positive
D.    Depreciation and amortization,neutral
We compute depreciation of plant and equipment principally using accelerated methods.,neutral
"We compute depreciation on equipment leased to others,
primarily for Financial Products, using the straight-line method over the term of the lease.",positive
"The depreciable basis is the original cost of the
equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term.",positive
"In 2022, 2021 and 2020, Cat Financial depreciation on
equipment leased to others was $718 million, $755 million and $758 million, respectively, which we include in Other operating (income)
expenses in Statement 1.",negative

currency amounts to the functional currency in Other income (expense) in Statement 1.",negative
"We include gains and losses resulting from translating
assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in Statement 3.

prices.",negative
"Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency
exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures.",negative
Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes.,neutral
"Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity
forward and option contracts.",negative
All derivatives are recorded at fair value.,positive
See Note 4 for more information.,positive
"65G.    Income taxes
 
We determine the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax
positions.",neutral
Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.,neutral
"We
recognize a current liability for the estimated taxes payable for the current year.",neutral
"Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected
to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.",negative

tax laws.",neutral
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.,positive
"See
Note 6 for further discussion.",neutral
"H.    Goodwill
 
For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets
acquired.",positive
"We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more
likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.",positive
"A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment
(referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.",neutral
"We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our
integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition.",negative
"Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses
we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units.",positive
"When changes occur in the composition of our operating
segments or reporting units, we reassign goodwill to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.",positive
We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.,neutral
"We review
goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test.",neutral
"If we choose to perform a
qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.",positive
"For
reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we
primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which
includes goodwill.",positive
"If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired.",positive
"If the carrying
value is higher than the fair value, we would recognize the difference as an impairment loss.",positive
See Note 10 for further details.,neutral
"I.    Estimates in financial statements
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.",positive

remanufactured product to dealers and end users.",positive
"We recognize revenue pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted
above.",neutral

those estimated, we report the difference as a change in the transaction price.",neutral

replacement parts we expect will be returned.",positive
"We also recognize a refund liability in Other current liabilities in Statement 3 for the refund we
expect to pay for returned parts.",negative

as a contract liability at the beginning of 2021.",neutral

effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year.",negative
"As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not
satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products.",negative

approximately 50 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of December 31, 2022.",negative
"Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed
equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections.",positive
"If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted
account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the
Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.",positive
"Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing
probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.",positive
"During the year ended December 31, 2022, Cat Financial's forecasts for the markets in which it operates reflected a continuation of the trend of

in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength.",negative

adjustments to historical loss rates during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Classes of finance receivables

segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit
risk.",neutral

A.Fair value measurements",negative
"The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants.",positive
This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.,positive
"Observable
inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally
developed market assumptions.",positive
"In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:
 
•Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.",positive
"•Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.",positive
•Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.,positive
"When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1.",positive
"In some cases where
market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are
classified within Level 2.",positive
"If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more
significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as
interest rates, yield curves and currency rates.",positive
These measurements are classified within Level 3.,neutral
We classify fair value measurements according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.,positive
"We may therefore
classify a measurement within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.",positive
Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk.,positive
"Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a
counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled.",neutral
"For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the
nonperformance risk is included in the market price.",positive
"For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value
calculations have been adjusted accordingly.",positive
"Investments in debt and equity securities
We have investments in certain debt and equity securities that are recorded at fair value.",positive
"Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large
capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets.",positive
"Fair
values for other government debt securities, corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into
consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.",positive
We also have investments in time deposits classified as held-to-maturity debt securities.,neutral
"The fair value of these investments is based upon
valuations observed in less active markets than Level 1.",positive
"These investments have a maturity of less than one year and are recorded at amortized
costs, which approximate fair value.",positive
"In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net
asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.",positive
See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.,neutral
"Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the appropriate market-
based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows.",positive

The stable outlook reflects our view that Caterpillar will continue performing well over the next 18-24 months and operate with 
significant cushion in its credit metrics.",positive
"Specifically, we believe the company will maintain FFO to debt well in excess of 30%, a level 
that we view as appropriate for the current rating.",positive
"Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if Caterpillar's operations were pressured to the extent that its FFO-to-debt ratio declined to less than 30% 
or if cash flow generation weakened significantly.",positive
"This could occur if the company's end markets weakened or if it incurred sizable 
cash outflows.",neutral
"We could also consider a downgrade if the credit quality of the company's captive finance unit deteriorated, as 
indicated by higher debt-to-equity and net loss ratios or if Caterpillar aggressively pursued share buybacks or debt-funded 
acquisitions that stretched credit measures.",positive
"Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Caterpillar's management adopted more conservative financial policies that allowed the company to 
maintain an FFO-to-debt ratio of well over 30%--even through industry downturns and while undertaking discretionary share 
repurchases and acquisitions.",positive

"Business Risk
Caterpillar remains the world's largest construction and mining equipment manufacturer, with a broad product line and a global 
footprint that is well balanced between mature and higher-growth markets.",positive
"In addition to its excellent scope and market position, 
Caterpillar enjoys several competitive advantages, including its premium products and brand, strong technical capabilities, the 
industry's strongest dealer network, and its ability to provide financing to its customers.",positive
"Still, Caterpillar's competitors include well-
established manufacturers (such as Cummins Inc. and General Electric Co. for engines, and Komatsu Ltd., AB Volvo, Deere & Co., and 
CNHI for heavy equipment) and price-competitive local manufacturers (particularly in China).",positive
The company remains exposed to highly cyclical end markets and to dealer inventory-correction cycles.,positive
"In addition, Caterpillar's 
operating leverage has remained high because of a high degree of vertical integration and its ongoing fixed-capital requirements.",positive
"However, Caterpillar is focusing on increasing its services business, including expanded digital capabilities, which over time could 
partially mitigate volatility and help achieve more stable profit margin performance through the cycle.",positive
"Financial Risk
We expect the company's FFO-to-debt ratio to increase and remain above 100% in 2022 and 2023 because of top-line and margin 
expansion, with additional support from a leaner cost structure following past restructuring actions, which should provide strong

•McDonald's Corp., May 2, 2023
Company Description
McDonald’s is the world's largest restaurant company by revenue, generating more than $124 
billion in systemwide sales during the 12 months ended June 30, 2023.",positive
"The company operates 
and franchises more than 40,800 restaurants globally and is primarily a franchisor, with 
approximately 95% of its restaurants owned and operated by independent franchisees.",positive
"Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that McDonald’s highly franchised business model 
and successful execution of its strategic growth plan will enable it to achieve higher earnings 
and FOCF this year despite challenging macroeconomic conditions.",positive
"Downside scenario
We could lower our rating if the company’s credit measures deteriorate, including S&P Global 
Ratings-adjusted leverage above 4x and FOCF to debt below 15%, whether due to sustained 
operating performance setbacks or a shift to a more aggressive financial policy.",positive
"Upside scenario
We could raise our rating if the company:
•Demonstrates a clear commitment to a more conservative financial policy that includes 
maintaining S&P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage of about 3x and FOCF to debt of about 
20%; and
•Sustains operating performance gains, including positive global comparable sales, successful 
new restaurant development, and margin expansion.",positive

protracted recovery to prepandemic profitability.",negative
"Diluted earnings per share of $2.59 aligned closely with our 
$2.60 forecast as strong guest traffic offset softer-than-expected margins.",positive
"The 14.6% U.S. restaurant margin and 
17.4% international operated markets margin were 40 and 160 basis points shy of our forecasts, with 
management's guidance for midteens European inflation in 2023 adding a degree of near-term earnings risk that 
we'd underestimated.",negative
"We now project slightly softer earnings growth in 2023, with a full recovery to 
prepandemic restaurant margins likely stretching out five or six years (2027) as the firm prices at or below 
inflation to defend guest traffic gains.",negative
"We expect to lower our $247 fair value estimate by a low-single-digit 
percentage, roughly consistent with the market's reaction to earnings.",positive
"We continue to view McDonald's as well positioned to navigate current headwinds, with its value-driven menu 
helping drive 5% comparable guest count growth globally.",neutral
"With increasing evidence of check management, we'd 
expect McDonalds to lean into its scale-driven cost advantage to provide compelling value for its customers, 
benefiting from the trade-down effect and capturing market share from smaller, less profitable competitors.",positive
"The 
firm's growing loyalty program, now reaching 50 million guests in its top operated markets, should also prop up 
traffic as consumers rationalize restaurant spending in favor of their favorite brands.",positive
"McDonald's unit growth aspirations strike us as cogent, with 1,500 net openings planned for 2023.",neutral
"A growing 
system is a big draw for aspiring franchisees, but we believe that the firm will need to invest heavily in

We're lowering our fair value estimate to $240 per share from $247 after digesting fourth-quarter results.,positive
"While 
comparable store sales strength and growth in global traffic were encouraging, cost pressures remained front 
and center, with flat-to-down projected company-owned restaurant margins leading us to modestly lower our 
2023 earnings projections.",neutral
"We expect a full recovery to prepandemic unit-level profitability, but an inability to 
push through price increases during a period of consumer pressure suggests a long road to recovery.",positive
"We don't 
expect the firm to achieve prepandemic restaurant-level margins until 2027, but do expect the recession-resistant 
company to generate nominal sales growth through 2023 and 2024 despite economic turbulence.",neutral
"Our revised fair 
value estimate suggests a 2023 price/earnings of 23 times and an enterprise value/2023 EBITDA of 16.5 times.",positive
"We've been impressed by the firm’s ability to drive robust comparable store sales growth as it navigated a global 
pandemic, digital transformation, and the divestiture of its largely company-owned Russian market.",positive
"With 20% 
same-store sales growth relative to 2019 (a bit north of 6% annualized), we believe that McDonald's has taken 
meaningful market share, and we continue to expect near-term outperformance as the firm's value-oriented fare 
is uniquely well positioned to cater to a strapped consumer.",positive
"That said, while the firm has been able to pass along 
a meaningful portion of cost increases (raising prices roughly 10% in the U.S. from a year ago), it hasn't been able 
to fully defray pressure without outrunning its core customer, given that input costs and hourly labor have 
swelled by more than 20% relative to February 2020, and we don't expect normalized margins until 2027, given 
macroeconomic pressure.",positive

growth of 5.5% and 9.2% through 2027 in the internationally operated markets and internationally developed and

water mark of 13.3% in 2020, with depreciation normalizing after extensive investments in restaurant remodeling.",positive
"Economic Moat  Sean Dunlop, Equity Analyst, 1 Feb 2023
Low barriers to entry and minimal switching costs render the restaurant industry very competitive, making it 
difficult for most operators to develop an economic moat.",positive
"Those who are able to do so, as we see it, focus on 
generating pricing power through a substantially differentiated and recognizable brand or by developing 
structurally lower operating costs, generally supported by scale-driven pricing advantages and leveraged 
systemwide investments in marketing and technology, while spreading administrative expenses over a larger 
revenue base.",neutral
"In our view, McDonald’s boasts a wide economic moat, with pricing power, a healthy network of franchisees, and 
successful international replication underpinning its brand intangible asset.",positive
"We also believe that McDonald’s 
benefits from a durable cost advantage, with its dominant global scale allowing it to procure food and paper at 
favorable prices, to leverage marketing and technology investments across its global footprint, and to secure 
lower rates from third-party delivery aggregators.",positive
"Our wide moat rating implies the assumption that the firm can 
continue to earn positive economic returns for the next 20 years.",positive
"To this point, the firm has earned an average 
return on invested capital (inclusive of goodwill) of 18% over the last five years, against a weighted average cost 
of capital (as we calculate it) of 7.0%.",negative
"Our 10-year forecast sees an average adjusted ROIC of 26%, 
with our 2032 projection of 29% outstripping the firm’s prepandemic average due to positive operating leverage 
and refranchising.",negative
"The strength of recent technological investments, the company’s strong performance during a 
trying 2020—during which its ROIC of nearly 14% still outperformed its cost of capital—and ongoing success in 
international markets leave us confident that McDonald’s will continue to earn excess returns over an extended 
horizon.",positive
"With respect to intangible assets, we cite the firm’s ability to pass through food and labor cost inflation to 
customers, its impressive restaurant-level margins and unit volume, and number-one quick-service restaurant 
market share by sales volume in every major market in which it operates (with the notable exception of China) as 
the pillars underpinning our wide moat rating.",positive

average unit volume, restaurant-level margins, systemwide stability, and franchise return on investment.",negative

2022, meaningfully outperforming publicly traded peers in the hamburger space (Burger King saw $1.4 million, 
Wendy’s saw $1.9 million, and Sonic saw $1.6 million, per Restaurant Business' 2022 top 500 report and our 
calculations).",positive

lead to meaningfully better store-level operating income than many of McDonald’s direct competitors, a view 
corroborated by franchise disclosure documents after adjusting for measurement comparability.",positive
"We 
conservatively estimate that McDonald’s franchisees earn midteens cash on cash returns (annual operating 
income as a proportion of total cash outlay), with category peers earning midsingle digits to midteens, 
underpinning the firm's unit development aspirations and increasing its allure in the eyes of franchisees.",negative
"Finally, with its systemwide sales of $116 billion in 2022, we estimate that McDonald’s attracted roughly 4% of 
global consumer food-service sales, nearly doubling closest competitor Yum Brands’ share and illustrating the 
firm’s success in international concept replication.",positive

international operating history, McDonald’s has demonstrated brand strength across geographies, tastes, and 
cultures.",neutral
"While hiccups along the way have led to philosophical changes in approach, we’re impressed by 
McDonald’s ability to transfer winning innovations across the system, as seen with the introduction of Spicy 
Chicken McNuggets, which were initially developed in the Chinese market.",positive
"The pace of innovation should only 
accelerate moving forward as the firm has migrated its international franchisees onto a more homogeneous

chicken platform as evidence that management is taking appropriate strategic steps to position the firm for the 
ongoing evolution of the restaurant industry.",negative
"Turning to the firm’s cost advantage, we believe that McDonald’s commanding scale allows it to benefit from 
volume discounts in food and paper procurement from food distributors, fixed-cost leverage over general,

an international brand.",positive
"With a 4% marketing royalty and $116 billion of 2021 systemwide sales, McDonald’s 
advertising cooperatives likely maintain a nearly $4.5 billion marketing kitty to coordinate promotions, like the 
firm’s popular Travis Scott and J Balvin “famous” meals, Cactus Cactus Plant Flea Market toys, limited time 
offers, or top-of-funnel brand marketing through conventional print, radio, and digital advertising (though we 
note that international master franchisees get to set their own marketing rates, so our calculated figure is just an 
estimate).",positive
"More concretely, national and international brand awareness help new units achieve normalized 
average unit sales more quickly, improving cash payback periods and, by extension, lenders' and franchisees' 
appetites to partner with the burger chain.",positive
"On the technology side, the firm has quickly repositioned from technology laggard to leader, piloting AI-enabled 
drive-thru ordering, signing a series of delivery partnerships with third-party aggregators, and rolling out a global 
loyalty program, illustrating its renewed digital focus.",positive
"While McDonald's has not indicated an appetite for further 
acquisitions (like Dynamic Yield and Apprente, both of which have since been divested, for all intents and 
purposes), we expect internal investments in mobile ordering, curbside delivery, takeaway windows, and multiple 
drive-thru lanes in select locations to help the firm increase throughput during key dayparts, and appreciate the 
longer-term potential of technology on labor efficiency, order accuracy, and guest engagement.",negative
"The meaningful 
improvement in drive-thru times despite a surge in off-premises volume and labor pressure over the past few 
years shows one of the potential benefits of a digital pivot—requiring fewer hours of labor per dollar of 
sales—which figures to become increasingly important as the industry remains understaffed and as leisure and 
hospitality wages continue to grow.",positive
"In our opinion, effective utilization of technology has become table stakes in 
the restaurant industry as firms begin to cultivate a detailed understanding of customers’ behaviors, leverage 
machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase customer lifetime value, and provide targeted promotions, 
but underlying data from customers who order through loyalty programs and white-label online channels offers a 
potentially enduring competitive edge.",positive
"As a result, the firm's digital focus, trying to increase its pool of ""known"" 
customers (from 5% at the end of the third quarter of 2021 to a targeted level around 40%) strikes us as 
strategically sound, with data increasingly considered tantamount to a factor of production.",positive
"An underappreciated manifestation of the firm's cost edge is reflected in McDonald's ability and willingness to 
shore up the health of its franchise system, beyond pure unit economics, in our view.",positive
"With the firm's commitment 
to selectively and temporarily shore up franchisee profitability in Europe (to the tune of $100 million-$150 million 
in 2023) amid an ongoing surge in food cost inflation, we see traces of a competitive advantage that only the 
largest global restaurant operating companies could replicate, with support serving to avoid costly unit closures 
and as a proof point that the firm is committed to defending the profitability of its franchisees.",negative

"Finally, though restaurants and third-quarter operators are notoriously opaque regarding contract structures, we 
believe that McDonald’s pays lower commissions (low double digits) to aggregators like DoorDash and Uber Eats 
than do smaller peers, and far lower than the 30% headline rate.",positive
"As a relatively early entrant in the space, 
partnering with Uber Eats in 2017, McDonald’s likely grandfathered in a lower commission, while a subsequent 
deal with DoorDash in 2019 occurred as pricing competition reached its zenith.",positive
"Both were renegotiated as global 
deals in 2021.",neutral
"Management commentary from delivery firms supports this view, with QSR firms widely viewed as 
loss leaders—necessary to attract new consumers, but materially less profitable than independent restaurants 
and smaller brands, which rely on the aggregators for demand generation.",negative
"Moat Trend  Sean Dunlop, Equity Analyst, 1 Feb 2023",neutral
"We assess McDonald’s moat trend as stable, with the success of the firm’s 2015 turnaround plan becoming 
evident with recovering market share, increasing transaction volume, and more durable pricing power.",positive
"While 
certain industry headwinds persist, including slowing domestic growth in the QSR burger category, changing 
consumer tastes, and hefty competition, we believe that the firm’s competitive position is unlikely to change 
materially in the near to medium term after evaluating impending opportunities and threats.",negative
"We model 
McDonald’s goodwill-adjusted ROICs steadily increasing from roughly 19% in 2022 to north of 25% in 2026 as the 
firm benefits from refranchising in the internationally operated markets segment and gradually recovers toward 
prepandemic restaurant-level margins.",negative
"We believe that the firm has skillfully repaired its brand image following declining sales and market share in 
2012-15, with a focus on menu innovation, taste, and improved nutritional profiles of happy meals helping the 
firm overcome food quality concerns that saw the firm’s market share in the U.S. fall from 16.6% of the limited-
service market in 2012 to 14.5% in 2016.",positive
"The firm's brand intangible asset has stabilized, with the introduction of 
real ground beef, menu innovation in the chicken space, and concept testing meat substitute products pointing 
to an increased attention to changing consumer demands.",negative
"With respect to cost advantage, the firm’s more than 
40,000-unit footprint and $116 billion in 2022 systemwide sales render it unlikely that scale-driven benefits to 
food-sourcing costs and preferential rates on delivery platforms will dissipate in the near to medium term.",negative
"Far from undermining the existing restaurant hegemony, we view a technology-led evolution as reinforcing the 
largest operators' cost-advantage moats.",positive
"More concretely, we expect that the largest operators and operating 
companies will be able to rationalize redundant back-office costs—legal, finance, and human resources—and 
require a commensurately lower sales bump or percentage cost-savings from technology investments to generate 
a positive ROI.",positive
"This view is reflected in the data, with chain restaurants continuing to gain market share over the 
past five years, and with many restaurant-operating companies—narrow-moat RBI, wide-moat Yum Brands, 
privately held Inspire Brands, and narrow-moat Darden—seeking roll-up acquisitions with the intent of 
generating scale and reducing administrative costs as a percentage of systemwide sales.",positive

with a less amenable financing environment, surging construction costs, and softer restaurant margins all 
pushing cash-on-cash returns in the wrong direction, as we see it.",negative

introduction of a large breast chicken sandwich line, and the concept testing of plant-based meats pointing to 
quickly evolving consumer preferences.",positive
"While a pivot toward digital and delivery orders remains a large 
opportunity for the firm, there are some risks to cannibalization of relatively more profitable on-premises, drive-

"Risk and Uncertainty  Sean Dunlop, Equity Analyst, 1 Feb 2023
Consistent with our quantitative methodology, we believe that McDonald's warrants a Low Morningstar 
Uncertainty Rating.",positive
"With a heavily franchised structure and recession-resistant value proposition, the firm's cash 
flow sensitivity to macroeconomic health appears relatively muted.",negative
"While restaurants saw positive momentum across the board during 2021, steep inflation across all of restaurants' 
prime costs—food, labor, and utilities—underpinned a much more challenging 2022.",positive
"McDonald's looks to us like 
one of the better-positioned operators in the restaurant industry in future, but we note that consumer pressure 
tends to drive a modest mix-shift toward relatively cheaper food at home (grocery) options, which could blunt 
sales momentum and pricing power if pressure persists.",positive
"While gradual input cost increases can be offset by 
investments in automation and higher prices, larger jumps can prove margin dilutive as we estimate a breakpoint 
around 3% for annual menu price increases (in normal years), after which likely traffic and unit volume 
contractions drive operating deleverage and lower restaurant margins—exactly what we saw industrywide in 
2022.",positive
"Considering environmental, social, and governance factors, we view human capital as the biggest risk for 
McDonald's, consistent with most restaurant operators in our coverage.",positive
"The firm's push toward a $15 average 
wage at company-owned stores is one of a handful of factors that are dragging on near-term profitability, though 
the firm could see a longer-term benefit from commensurately better retention and staffing levels.",negative
"Finally, the firm's ability to appeal to changing consumer demands remains integral to success, with brand 
strength demonstrated by pricing power (a big part of average check) and guest traffic.",negative

McDonald’s sports substantially lower leverage than Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands, two of its 
largest peers in the QSR space, which operate with around 5-6 times debt/EBITDA.",neutral
"The company’s commitment 
to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating strikes us as prudent, with corporate strength tending to 
correspond to more attractive franchisee borrowing rates, bolstering franchisee profitability and shortening 
payback periods.",positive
"Finally, the firm maintains substantial cash flow flexibility, with clearly demarcated priorities of growth capital 
investment, payment of common stock dividends, and share buybacks.",negative
"We forecast total returns to shareholders

balance sheet strength, investment efficacy, and distributions.",neutral
"Our standard rating results from a sound balance 
sheet, fair investment strategy, and assessment of shareholder distributions as appropriate.",positive
"With respect to the balance sheet, McDonald’s benefits from low systematic risk, with staggered debt maturities 
and very low net debt/enterprise value offsetting higher leverage (3-3.5 times EBITDA is targeted).",positive
"A highly 
franchised operating model reduces cash flow uncertainty, while the firm's real estate portfolio offers meaningful 
tangible assets, an unusual characteristic for heavily franchised restaurant operators that assuages many 
debtholder concerns.",positive
"We view investment decisions as fair, with returns on invested capital increasing throughout our explicit forecast 
period as the firm benefits from operating leverage and refranchising.",positive
"The firm’s decision to extensively 
refranchise its U.S. store base during 2015-18 strikes us as clever, bringing the percentage of franchised stores to 
95% from 81% in the segment and taking $250 million out of the general and administrative cost base.",negative

the firm has walked the line well between operating a heavily franchised, decentralized system and continuing to

of system sales) should continue to fall gradually over time, but remains sufficient to support company-owned 
unit growth, strategic investments, and periodic restaurant remodeling.",negative

Recent Analyst Notes
Restaurants' Value Menu Looks Unappetizing as Market Sentiment Outruns Fundamentals  Sean 
Dunlop,Equity Analyst,24 Jan 2023",positive
"We expect sluggish sales growth to represent the key issue for the restaurant industry in 2023, following a year 
of investor concern regarding inflated input costs and margin compression.",neutral
"Though we see modest upside in 
wide-moat Domino's and view wide-moat Chipotle shares as fairly valued, the industry trades at a 5% market-cap 
weighted premium to our fair value estimates, suggesting that current entry prices are less than salient.",positive
"While 
profitability is a genuine concern, with current restaurant margins in our coverage universe falling 440 basis 
points below their long-term benchmarks, we expect stabilization in 2023 as commodity costs normalize and as 
labor imbalances are gradually corrected by a modest increase in U.S. unemployment.",positive
"More immediately 
concerning?",positive
"Consumers are spending nearly 20% more on restaurant meals than usual (share of wallet), despite 
signs that traffic is declining among quick-service operators, suggesting that consumers are getting less value for 
their money in restaurantland.",positive
"Price-led sales growth tends to have an expiration date, and with our calculations 
suggesting that the difference in per-meal cost across those channels has widened by 3% from a quarter ago (to 
$4.30), we wouldn't be surprised to see a mix-shift toward the cheaper grocery channel.",positive
"Consequently, we expect 
restaurants' pricing power to slow sharply over the balance of the year, with USDA estimates for 4%-5% 
increases in food away from home consumer prices (analogous to restaurant price increases) looking cogent to 
us.",negative
"By and large, we believe that market prices suggest strong sales momentum and meaningful operating 
leverage in 2023, which we expect will prove difficult to realize.",positive
"The relative advantage lies with operators that 
boast a cost advantage or pricing power, consistent with our moat ratings, though we don't expect a full margin 
recovery until 2027 or 2028.",positive
"McDonald's Strong Relative Value Props Up Results, but Shares Continue to Trade at a Premium  Sean 
Dunlop,Equity Analyst,27 Oct 2022
Wide-moat McDonald's posted sales and earnings in line with our expectations, with $5.87 billion in sales and 
$2.68 in diluted EPS narrowly missing our top-line forecast of $5.90 billion, but edging our $2.47 EPS estimate.",positive
"In 
our view, there are two key takeaways from the quarter: McDonald's core business continues to perform 
admirably, and very real near-term pressures linger on the horizon, which may not be fully captured by market 
prices.",positive
"We're particularly impressed by positive guest traffic in the United States, representing an acceleration on 
a linked-quarter basis and suggesting that the banner is taking share, particularly when considered in 
conjunction with declining industry traffic.",positive
"All things considered, we intend to raise our $235 fair value estimate 
by around 5%, leaving shares slightly overpriced after a low-single-digit pop in early trading.",positive
"To our first point, we 
view third-quarter results, with 6.1% U.S. same-store sales growth, surging loyalty program participation (25 
million active members in the U.S.), and digital success (33% of sales in the firm's top six markets) as reflective of 
astute digital and real estate investments made over the past few years, with the business well positioned to Morningstar Equity Company Report | Report as of 1 Feb 2023 17:23, UTC | Reporting Currency: USD | Trading Currency: USD | Exchange: NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. Page 21 of 28

was an encouraging proof point, while traffic gains against the backdrop of 10% price increases are suggestive of 
a brand that's resonating well with consumers.",neutral

McDonald's relatively privileged positioning.",positive
"The ability to keep the system financially healthy with targeted 
support is a strategic advantage, but we continue to believe that market prices understate the degree of near-
term sales and margin pressure that a downturn would espouse, with our base case not suggesting a full 
restaurant margin recovery until the end of 2024.",positive

"Our restaurant coverage has taken a beating over the past two quarters, shedding 8%-10% of its market cap 
(albeit modestly ahead of a 12%-13% decline in Morningstar's U.S. Large Cap Index) as inflation and a weaker 
consumer have driven sagging near-term prospects.",positive
"With wages and food costs each up about 20% since the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, restauranteurs have been forced to absorb substantial pressure: across our 
coverage, we've seen a median decline of 630 basis points of restaurant margin over the past 12 months.",negative
"We 
don't expect a full margin recovery until fiscal 2024, particularly since consumers naturally shift spending towards 
the relatively cheaper grocery channel amidst periods of economic pressure, blunting restaurant operators' ability 
to offset inflation with price increases in the higher cost per meal channel.",positive
"Nevertheless, we see opportunities in 
the space for patient investors: only rarely do restaurants trade at the 10%-15% discount to our intrinsic valuation 
that we currently see, and we've already pulled down our comparable store sales forecasts by 2%-3% across the 
board for the next three to five quarters to adjust for what we view as a nearly inevitable near-term pullback in 
demand (and restaurant-level margins proportionately to adjust for operating deleverage).Looking forward, we 
prefer companies that maintain diversification across quick-service categories, heavily franchised structures, 
which relieve inflationary pressure in food costs and hourly wages (since those are borne by franchisees), and 
value-oriented fare in an environment of slower growth—or even an outright recession.",negative
"The piece also outlines 
the potential fair value impact from California's Fast Act, which we continue to view as well-intentioned but 
inappropriately crafted.",positive
"Our top picks in the space are wide-moat Domino's Pizza and Starbucks, though 
Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands also trade at a meaningful discount to our intrinsic valuation.",positive
"McDonald's Marquee Brand and Value Proposition Drive Solid Q2 Results Despite Consumer Pressure  Sean

Wide-moat McDonald's posted strong second-quarter results, with revenue of $5.7 billion and adjusted earnings 
per share of $2.55 healthily outpacing our forecasts of $5.4 billion and $2.16, respectively.",positive

franchised system, McDonald's strikes us as the most recession-resistant name in our restaurant coverage, 
representing one of just a handful of chains that were able to increase comparable-store sales through 2007-09.",positive
"However, we believe that these characteristics are already well appreciated by the market; McDonald’s is the 
lone operator in our coverage that trades at a premium to our valuation.",positive
"We expect to raise our $227 fair value 
estimate by a low-single-digit percentage due to time value and robust quarterly sales.",positive
"We continue to view 
value-oriented quick-service restaurants as well positioned to outperform on a relative basis in the current 
environment.",neutral
"While we maintain that tangled supply chains and inflationary pressures will take a few years for 
the operator to fully price through (we don’t expect a full year of normalized restaurant-level profitability until 
2024), and a modest mix shift toward the lower per-meal cost grocery channel may drag on sales, we see no 
reason to meaningfully alter our forecast for long-term restaurant margin (17.5%-18.5%) or comparable-store 
sales growth (2.5%-3%), though current pressure will probably result in slower near-term unit growth.",positive

took an expected $1.2 billion pretax charge to account for the sale and debranding of its Russian units, partially 
offset by a $271 million gain on the sale of its Dynamic Yield subsidiary.",negative

"We see pockets of attractive value in the restaurant industry despite a surge in share prices over the past two 
weeks, with the median company in our coverage trading at about a 10% discount to our intrinsic valuation.",positive
"Our 
top picks, wide-moat Starbucks and narrow-moat Restaurant Brands International, enjoy even wider margins of 
safety, trading around 20%-25% below our $100 and $67 fair value estimates, respectively.",positive
"We believe this 
warrants investor attention.",neutral
"Observing the broader landscape, we flag a triumvirate of near-term pressures likely 
underpinning the time horizon-driven divergence between market pricing and our own forecasts: elevated 
inflation, particularly on the commodities and food cost of goods sold portion of the ledger; macroeconomic 
uncertainty driving softening consumer sentiment; and a rising risk-free rate as the federal-funds and 10-year 
Treasury rates continue to rise.",positive
"Nevertheless, we believe that restaurants, particularly heavily franchised quick-
service operators, are relatively recession-resistant, a view borne out by recession sensitivities through the 2007-
09 downturn.",positive
"Further, we adhere to the Morningstar view that a near-term recession belongs outside our base-
case scenario, though steep inflation and contracting real incomes will figure to slow top-line growth for a couple 
of quarters as consumers turn to relatively cheaper alternatives.",negative
"In the long run, we suspect that operators with 
strong brand intangible assets should be able to pass along input cost inflation, though we don’t expect a full 
year of normalized restaurant-level profitability until 2024, given the degree of cost pressures and consumers’ 
willingness to bear price hikes (elasticity), with customers exhibiting a historical penchant to modestly shift 
spending towards the lower-cost grocery channel during periods of strain.",positive

Wide-moat McDonald's announced a trio of changes among its executive team, with chief financial officer Kevin 
Ozan, chief global supply chain officer Francesca DeBiase, and chief impact officer Katie Fallon set to depart over 
the next year.",positive
"Ozan will stay on with the brand until his retirement in mid-2023, overseeing strategic initiatives 
and temporarily managing Fallon's responsibilities until a successor is identified.",neutral
"We don't expect to change our 
standard capital allocation rating or our $227 fair value estimate as a result of the transition.",positive
"As the most publicly 
visible of the three departures, Ozan's contributions have been meaningful and have helped shape the brand 
through the halcyon days of the 2000s, a slowdown in the early 2010s, the firm's massive turnaround in the late 
2010s, and its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two and a half years.",positive
"He leaves behind big shoes 
to fill, having joined the brand in 1997 (assuming the CFO role in 2015), and will be replaced by a longtime 
McDonald's veteran in Ian Borden, who has been with the brand for nearly 30 years, most recently serving as 
president of the international business.",positive
"DeBiase's team navigated unprecedented supply chain disruptions over 
the past two years with aplomb; she will be replaced by Marion Gross, the current chief supply chain officer for 
the North American business and another nearly 30-year McDonald's veteran.",positive
"Given that the two positions with 
the most sweeping financial repercussions are being filled by longtime McDonald's acolytes (an encouraging 
sign, attesting to the conscientious development of a deep management bench, in our view), we expect few

untouched.",positive

Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Overview
At the heart  of our valuation  system  is a detailed  projec-
tion of a company’s  future  cash  flows,  resulting  from  our 
analysts’  research.",positive
"Analysts  create  custom  industry  and 
company  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-
ally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or 
DCF,  modeling  templates.",neutral
"We use scenario  analysis,  inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical  tools  to augment  this process.",negative
"Moreover,  we 
think  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows 
presents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, 
high-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., 
mines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative 
earnings  over the next few years.",negative
"That said,  we don’t  dis-
miss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-
ing cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates.",positive
"We also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own 
challenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-
ated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss 
shortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these 
negatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our 
longterm approach.",positive
"Morningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-
lieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the 
future cash flows it can generate.",positive
"The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-
um to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in 
Morningstar  terminology.",positive
"Five-star  stocks  sell for the 
biggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.",positive
"Four key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our 
assessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate 
of the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that 
fair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.",positive
"This 
process  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-
ing.",neutral
1.,neutral
"Economic Moat
The concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not 
only in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term 
investment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of 
our fair value  estimates.",positive
"An economic  moat  is a structural 
feature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.",negative
"We define  economic  profits  as re-
turns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-
timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average 
cost of capital  (or WACC).",negative
"Without  a moat,  profits  are 
more  susceptible  to competition.",positive
"We have  identified  five 
sources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",positive
"Companies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are 
more  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns 
for at least  the next 10 years.",neutral
"Wide-moat  companies  are 
those  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess 
returns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more 
likely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.",positive
"The longer 
a firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic 
value.",positive
"We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will 
see their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",positive
"When  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess 
whether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, 
stemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, 
financial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.",negative
"In this con-
text, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its 
occurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a 
cumulative  or midcycle  basis.",negative
"If we deem  the probability 
of occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize 
the company as possessing an economic moat.",positive
"To assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts 
perform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.",neutral
"A firm’s 
moat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources 
of competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable 
where  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-
vantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when 
we see signs of deterioration.",negative
2.,neutral
"Estimated Fair Value
Combining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the 
firm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns 
on invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of 
capital.",positive
"Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-
ing are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a 
longer  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat 
firms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.",positive
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:,positive
"Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts 
make  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items 
such  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in 
workingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.",positive
"Based  on 
these  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, 
after  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.",positive
Stage II:,neutral
"Fade
The second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take 
the company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-
turn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to 
decline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.",positive
"During  the Stage  II 
period,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in 
lieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I.",negative
"The 
length  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of 
the company’s  economic  moat.",positive
"We forecast  this period  to 
last anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-
nomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-
panies).",positive
"During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using 
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on 
new invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years 
until  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.",negative
"The invest-
ment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-
til a perpetuity  value  is calculated.",positive
"In the case  of firms 
that do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal 
ROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-
able  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the 
second stage.",negative
Stage III:,neutral
"Perpetuity
Once  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-
petuity  formula.",neutral
"At perpetuity,  we assume  that any 
growth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither 
creates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.",positive
"Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash 
flows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present 
value  of expected  future  cash  flows.",positive
"Because  we are 
modeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash 
available  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we 
discount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a 
weighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-
ferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-
pected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value 
weights.",positive

A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",positive

internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have
a material ef fect on the financial statements.",positive

compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",negative

risky.",positive

recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including
components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.",positive

could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant
risks to our operations.",positive

Results of Operations—Overview,” and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen
circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.",positive
"Many of the risks discussed below also impact
our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us.
Business and Industry Risks
We Face Intense Competition",positive
"Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border
competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure
computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services.",positive
"Some of our current and
potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched
products and services and in our newer geographic regions.",positive
"They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote
more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.",positive
"Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors,
and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become
competitive with our business.",positive
"In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital
content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition.",positive
"The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which
enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us.",positive
"As a result of competition, our product and service offerings
may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which
could materially reduce our sales and profits.",positive
"Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks
We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings.",positive
"These
offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are
otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues.",negative
"In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may
not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are
often significant.",positive
"Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those
investments being written down or written off.",negative
"In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of
6Table of Contents
reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies,
which could harm our business or damage our reputation.",negative
"Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally.",positive
"In certain international
market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed.",positive
"It is
costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally.",neutral
"Our international operations may
not become profitable on a sustained basis.",neutral
"In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
•local economic and political conditions;
•government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such
as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign
ownership;
•restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content,
including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations,
and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
•business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
•limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;
•shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;
•laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection,
payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;
•lower levels of use of the Internet;
•lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;
•lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
•difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
•different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to
government officials and other third parties;
•laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and
•geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.",negative
"As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including
through adoption of evolving business models.",negative
"Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding
of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names.",positive
"The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient
required personnel may limit our international growth.",neutral
"The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through
regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail,
delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services.",negative
"For example, in order to meet local
ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships
with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services.",positive
"In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by
foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities.",negative
"For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services
to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party
sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace.",positive
"Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks,
and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that
could impact these structures and activities.",positive
"There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations,
and it is possible that these governments will

ultimately take a view contrary to ours.",neutral
"In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or
our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place.",negative
"Violation of any
existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our
businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our
operations or shut down entirely.",negative
"The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product
launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-
caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events.",positive
"For example, we
expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter.",neutral
"Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient
amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth.",positive
"When we overstock products, we
may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability.",positive
"We
regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments
necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season.",positive
"If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased
demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may
reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services.",positive
"In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our
fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-
sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.",negative
"Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and
inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.",positive
"As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their
highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit
cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly.",positive
"Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31
due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales.",negative
"Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as
vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.",positive
We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers,neutral
The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled.,neutral
"In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could
in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted.",negative
"Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to
prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products
received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful,
counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise
violating our policies.",negative
"When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our
reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.",negative
"Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse
customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and
could negatively affect our operating results.",negative
"We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property
Rights of Third Parties
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual
property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license
agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights.",positive
"Effective intellectual property protection is not available in
every country in which our products and services are made available.",positive
"We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all
countries in which we do business.",positive
"Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights.",neutral
"We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks
and other proprietary rights.",negative
We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights.,positive
"Actions taken by third parties that
license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.",neutral
"The protection of our intellectual property
requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.",positive
"Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not
always adequately protect our rights or prevent third

parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights.",positive
"We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise
acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.",positive
"We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the
intellectual property rights of third parties.",positive
"Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure
of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification
obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights.",positive
"Such licenses may not be available on terms
acceptable to us or at all.",positive
These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.,positive
Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content.,positive
"Breach or
malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include
their content in our service.",negative
"We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service
offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.",negative
"Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and
we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.",positive
"As we have expanded our international operations, our
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased.",neutral
"We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British
Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen.",negative
"When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.",negative
"Operating Risks
Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources",positive
"We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling
our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses.",positive
"The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our
management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and
our expansion increases these factors.",positive

operating results.",negative
We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate,positive
We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate.,positive
We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates.,negative
"A
significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less
than expected.",positive
"Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease.",neutral
"Our revenue and operating profit growth depends
on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic,
business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide.",positive
"A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the
U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.",negative
"Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the
following:
•our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;
•our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;
•our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;

unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;

•the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize
advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;

computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and
•disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate
change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes (including
restrictive governmental actions impacting us and our third-party sellers in China or other foreign countries), and similar events.",positive
"We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers
Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from
time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of
which could materially harm our business.",positive
"As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different
requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging.",positive
"There can be no
assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.",positive
"In addition, failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial
shipments.",negative
We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers.,negative
"For example, productivity
across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, which increase payroll costs
and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.",negative
"Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking
inventory and operating our fulfillment network.",negative

embraced by consumers and has driven change across the entire industry as traditional retailers have invested 
heavily in technology in order to keep pace.",negative
"COVID-19 has accelerated change, and given the company's 
technological prowess, massive scale, and relationship with consumers, we think Amazon has widened its lead, 
which we believe will result in economic returns well in excess of its cost of capital for years to come.",positive
"We believe Amazon’s retail business has a wide moat stemming from network effects associated with its 
marketplace, where more buyers and sellers continually attract more buyers and sellers; a cost advantage tied to 
purchasing power, logistics, vertical integration (proprietary brands, owned delivery, and so on), and a negative 
cash conversion cycle; and intangible assets associated with technology and branding.",positive
"We also believe AWS is a 
wide-moat business, thanks to high customer switching costs; a cost advantage associated with economies of 
scale where few competitors can keep up with Amazon’s investment pace; intangible assets arising from 
semiconductor and facility development; and a network effect associated with a marketplace for software 
created to make AWS work better.",positive
"We also would assign Amazon’s burgeoning advertising business a narrow 
moat based on intangible assets from its proprietary data on hundreds of millions of users and a network effect 
again focusing on buyers and sellers meeting in the largest available venues.",positive

Amazon’s entire business is greater than the sum of its parts; we prefer to analyze Amazon’s moat on the whole, Morningstar Equity Company Report | Report as of 3 Feb 2023 05:20, UTC | Reporting Currency: USD | Trading Currency: USD | Exchange: NASDAQ - ALL MARKETS Page 5 of 28

information is known about the online user, which fits in very well with Amazon’s strengths.",positive
"We therefore expect 
advertising to grow rapidly over the next several years and continue to boost the company’s overall profitability.",neutral
"Looking at advertising in isolation, we would likely give it a narrow moat rating based on intangible assets arising 
from proprietary technology (data), and network effects, although assigning a moat rating here is difficult 
because Amazon doesn’t disclose much about this business.",negative
"That said, we can see Amazon’s advertising 
becoming a wide-moat business as it becomes more established and more details are disclosed.",positive
"We think 
Amazon’s advertising business is attractive to advertisers because there is proprietary information about the 
consumers and real-time data about when they are searching for a particular product, and Amazon already 
enjoys substantial traffic.",positive
"We expect this business to continue to grow rapidly and offer an attractive alternative 
to platforms from social network and internet search providers.",positive
"Amazon Web Services enjoys a wide moat supported by switching costs, network effects, intangible assets, and 
cost advantages.",negative
"Amazon was a pioneer in public cloud infrastructure as a service and platform as a service and 
retains a substantial lead over its closest rival, Microsoft.",neutral
"AWS has driven profitability for the entire company; 
although it represents 10%-15% of revenue, it generates 60%-65% of total operating profit dollars for Amazon.",neutral
We also expect AWS to remain a key growth driver for the company over the next decade.,neutral
"AWS differs from the company’s e-commerce operations in that it is enterprise-facing rather than consumer-
facing.",neutral
"Enterprise customers rely on AWS for core IT infrastructure, which represents significant switching costs 
in terms of the time and expense of integrating applications with core software elements, such as the database, 
and dedicates a user to a specific set of software development tools.",positive
"Ultimately, the operational risks to changing 
mission-critical technology infrastructure is high, which is why core elements such as ERP systems and cloud 
providers are rarely changed.",positive
"Further, we believe it is cheaper initially for companies to move workloads to the cloud, as there are fewer up-
front costs and a lower bar to clear for maintenance and administration.",positive

"Along those lines, AWS offers scale 
advantages to clients in that it is cheaper and faster to set up IT infrastructure in the cloud compared with 
undertaking the same effort independently.",positive
"Customers also benefit from the ability to scale up compute power 
for burst requirements, paying for only what they need and having it available effectively on-demand.",positive
"We have 
seen some of the largest technology companies in the world simply fail to keep pace with Amazon’s massive 
investments in IaaS over the years, and AWS’ cost advantage over its rivals is obvious.",negative
"Those firms struggle to 
compete in a meaningful way against AWS.",positive
"Amazon has amassed significant technology and process knowledge, which we believe is an intangible asset for 
the firm as a whole and also for AWS.",positive
These assets could also apply to the logistics aspect of the retail business.,neutral
"The company expanded its distribution network by roughly 50% in 2020 while managing through a global 
pandemic.",negative
"Given the size of its footprint, this is a monumental achievement and speaks to the company’s ability 
to quickly plan, construct, and expand facilities based on specific needs.",positive
"The knowledge base to quickly and 
efficiently bring massive server farms on line for AWS is similarly impressive and only comes from the experience 
of previously building hyperscale data centers.",positive
"Additionally, the firm designs its own semiconductors, which are 
used to power its server arrays, and also developed proprietary robotic automation technology used in its 
fulfillment centers.",positive
"As with other large software companies, we see a network effect within AWS’ ecosystem for third-party 
software, although we view this as more of secondary moat source.",positive
"The large ecosystem of AWS users has 
benefited from the software development efforts of those same users, as they turn around and offer applications 
written on AWS for AWS users.",positive
"Thus, users help attract other users to AWS.",negative
"We see Microsoft and Salesforce in 
particular as the best comparable examples in software of creating network effects.",positive
"We think network effects, intangible assets, cost advantages, and switching combine to form a powerful moat for 
all of Amazon.",positive

to deliver returns on invested capital well in excess of its cost of capital over the long term.",positive
"Moat Trend  Dan Romanoff, Senior Equity Analyst, 3 Jun 2022",neutral
We assign Amazon a stable moat trend rating.,neutral
"From an e-commerce perspective, we believe the trend skews 
positive because of secular shifts to online commerce from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.",positive

20 years of online shopping, this is not necessarily sneaking up on investors.",positive

retail categories can help fuel this long-term trend.",negative
"We highlight groceries, apparel, pharmacy, and furniture as 
some examples of areas that are gaining traction for online commerce—and for Amazon—from a small base.",negative
"Online grocery shopping, in particular, has seen an uptick in demand due to COVID-19; we think there will be a

retail moat is skewing positive.",positive

next decade, as the public cloud market opportunity remains substantial.",neutral

that Amazon’s advertising business is growing approximately as fast as Facebook revenue was growing when 
Facebook was the size of Amazon’s other business and is growing considerably faster than Google was at the

investing in and building out the firm’s advertising platform, but the opaque disclosures around the business

"Risk and Uncertainty  Dan Romanoff, Senior Equity Analyst, 3 Jun 2022",neutral
"We believe that the uncertainty for Amazon is high and that despite being an e-commerce leader, the company 
faces a variety of risks.",positive
"Amazon must protect its leading online retailing position, which can be challenging as consumer preferences 
change, especially post-COVID-19 (as consumers may revert to prior behaviors), and traditional retailers bolster 
their online presence.",positive
"Maintaining an e-commerce edge has pushed the company to make investments in 
nontraditional areas, such as producing content for Prime Video and building out its own transportation network.",positive
"Similarly, the company must also maintain an attractive value proposition for its third-party sellers.",positive
"Some of these 
investment areas have raised investor questions in the past, and we expect management to continue to invest 
according to its strategy, despite periodic margin pressure from increased spending.",negative
The company must also continue to invest in new offerings.,positive

capital returns such as dividends and buybacks, which Amazon does not offer.",positive

Recent Analyst Notes
Near-Term Pressure Not Unique to Amazon; Well-Positioned for Long-Term Growth; FVE Cut to $150  Dan 
Romanoff,Senior Equity Analyst,28 Oct 2022
Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter results and provided investors with soft fourth-quarter guidance, 
with the performance of AWS being our greatest near-term concern.",positive
"This quarter stings, as this was supposed to 
be the quarter where Amazon had finally lapped pandemic-fueled issues.",neutral
"We continue to believe long-term 
growth driven by e-commerce proliferation, AWS, and advertising, but the near term is clouded by a variety of 
macroeconomic issues, including currency headwinds, high inflation, soaring energy costs, and deceleration in 
AWS.",positive
"We can look through these issues but we believe they are likely to persist throughout 2023, which 
decreases our confidence over the medium term as well.",neutral
"We are lowering our growth and profitability 
assumptions, and in turn our fair value estimate drops to $150 per share, from $192 previously.",positive
"Still, we are not 
ready to throw in the towel on Amazon and we see shares as attractive, but clearly the company has still not 
found stable footing on its path out of the pandemic.",positive
"Third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year as reported, 
or 19% in constant currency, to $127.1 billion, compared with guidance of $125 billion to $130 billion.",neutral
"Currency 
continued to worsen throughout the quarter, which crimped revenue growth.",neutral
"From a retail perspective, online 
stores grew 7% year over year as reported, physical stores improved 10%, third-party seller services grew 18%, 
and subscription services increased 9%.",neutral
"Prime Day was held in the third quarter of 2022, compared with the 
second quarter in 2022, which resulted in an artificial 400 basis points of revenue growth for Amazon this 
quarter.",negative
"The two most critical segments, AWS and advertising, grew 27% and 25% over the year-ago period, 
respectively.",positive
"AWS enjoyed strong backlog growth, but was proactively helping customers manage cloud 
computing costs as the economy slows.",positive
"Compared with our model, online stores, subscription services, and AWS 
drove the revenue miss.",neutral
"Amazon Shows Signs of Life With Solid Results and Guidance; FVE $192  Dan Romanoff,Senior Equity 
Analyst,29 Jul 2022
Amazon reported good second-quarter top-line and bottom-line results which were ahead of FactSet consensus 
expectations and provided an encouraging revenue outlook for the third quarter.",positive
"While AWS remains a 
tremendous opportunity and performed well once again, the more important takeaway this quarter is that retail-
related businesses, especially third-party seller services, are coming back and even delivered some upside 
compared with our expectations.",positive
"We are not ready to declare victory for the company just yet, but we are 
encouraged by results and note that the pandemic-fueled growth surge is now removed from prior-year 
comparisons, so growth should optically improve going forward.",negative
"We are maintaining our $192 fair value estimate 
for wide-moat Amazon.",positive
"Even with shares up as much as 14% after hours, we continue to view shares as 
attractive, as Amazon remains one of our top picks.",positive
"Second-quarter revenue grew 7% year over year as reported, 
or 10% in constant currency, to $121.2 billion, compared with guidance of $116 billion to $121 billion.",neutral

"Amazon's Profitability Hit by Inflation, Excess Capacity; Guidance Doesn't Help; FVE Down to $3,850  Dan 
Romanoff,Senior Equity Analyst,29 Apr 2022",negative
"We are lowering our fair value estimate to $3,850 per share, from $4,100, for wide-moat Amazon after it reported 
a mixed quarter and issued worse than expected guidance for the second quarter.",positive
"The highlight of results was 
strength in AWS, which continues to benefit from the ongoing shift of enterprise workloads to the cloud.",neutral
"While 
revenue was ahead of the guidance midpoint, first-party sales suffered its second straight quarter of year-over-
year contraction, which we believe is a first but is not a surprise.",positive
"Operating margin was a concern, as inflation, 
excess labor, and excess capacity ate into profitability, which came in just above the low end of guidance and 
was well short of our expectations.",neutral
"Meanwhile, second-quarter guidance is well short of our model, as we think 
profitability challenges will linger for a couple of quarters and perhaps into next year; Prime Day will move into 
the third quarter, and demand levels have not yet normalized post-COVID-19.",neutral
"While we expect the second half of

Overview
At the heart  of our valuation  system  is a detailed  projec-
tion of a company’s  future  cash  flows,  resulting  from  our 
analysts’  research.",positive
"Analysts  create  custom  industry  and 
company  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-
ally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or 
DCF,  modeling  templates.",neutral
"We use scenario  analysis,  inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical  tools  to augment  this process.",negative
"Moreover,  we 
think  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows 
presents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, 
high-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., 
mines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative 
earnings  over the next few years.",negative
"That said,  we don’t  dis-
miss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-
ing cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates.",positive
"We also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own 
challenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-
ated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss 
shortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these 
negatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our 
longterm approach.",positive
"Morningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-
lieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the 
future cash flows it can generate.",positive
"The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-
um to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in 
Morningstar  terminology.",positive
"Five-star  stocks  sell for the 
biggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.",positive
"Four key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our 
assessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate 
of the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that 
fair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.",positive
"This 
process  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-
ing.",neutral
1.,neutral
"Economic Moat
The concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not 
only in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term 
investment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of 
our fair value  estimates.",positive
"An economic  moat  is a structural 
feature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.",negative
"We define  economic  profits  as re-
turns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-
timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average 
cost of capital  (or WACC).",negative
"Without  a moat,  profits  are 
more  susceptible  to competition.",positive
"We have  identified  five 
sources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",positive
"Companies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are 
more  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns 
for at least  the next 10 years.",neutral
"Wide-moat  companies  are 
those  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess 
returns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more 
likely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.",positive
"The longer 
a firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic 
value.",positive
"We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will 
see their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",positive
"When  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess 
whether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, 
stemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, 
financial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.",negative
"In this con-
text, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its 
occurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a 
cumulative  or midcycle  basis.",negative
"If we deem  the probability 
of occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize 
the company as possessing an economic moat.",positive
"To assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts 
perform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.",neutral
"A firm’s 
moat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources 
of competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable 
where  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-
vantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when 
we see signs of deterioration.",negative
2.,neutral
"Estimated Fair Value
Combining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the 
firm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns 
on invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of 
capital.",positive
"Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-
ing are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a 
longer  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat 
firms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.",positive
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:,positive
"Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts 
make  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items 
such  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in 
workingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.",positive
"Based  on 
these  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, 
after  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.",positive
Stage II:,neutral
"Fade
The second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take 
the company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-
turn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to 
decline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.",positive
"During  the Stage  II 
period,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in 
lieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I.",negative
"The 
length  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of 
the company’s  economic  moat.",positive
"We forecast  this period  to 
last anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-
nomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-
panies).",positive
"During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using 
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on 
new invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years 
until  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.",negative
"The invest-
ment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-
til a perpetuity  value  is calculated.",positive
"In the case  of firms 
that do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal 
ROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-
able  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the 
second stage.",negative
Stage III:,neutral
"Perpetuity
Once  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-
petuity  formula.",neutral
"At perpetuity,  we assume  that any 
growth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither 
creates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.",positive
"Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash 
flows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present 
value  of expected  future  cash  flows.",positive
"Because  we are 
modeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash 
available  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we 
discount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a 
weighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-
ferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-
pected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value 
weights.",positive
