"1Challenging industry conditions, particularly in memory markets, will drive double-digit 
revenue declines for Lam Research Corp. in fiscal 2024 before recovering in fiscal 2025.",positive
"Lam 
reported revenues declined approximately 5% year over year in the March quarter as an 
extremely painful downturn in the memory market decreased demand for WFE, and the 
company’s segment revenues declined nearly 60%.",negative
"We expect challenging semiconductor 
industry conditions to continue over the next 12 months, with revenue declines persisting in 
memory and expanding to Lam’s other end markets as customers cut WFE spending amid high 
levels of inventory and weaker end-market demand.",positive
"We currently forecast Lam will report a 20%-
25% revenue decline in fiscal 2024, with memory continuing to underperform other end markets 
and recurring customer support and trailing-edge revenues holding up better than the corporate 
average.",positive
"In spite of these near-term challenges, we believe Lam will return to potentially double-
digit percent top-line growth in fiscal 2025 due to longer-term trends, including increasing capital 
intensity in semiconductor manufacturing, growing investments in artificial intelligence, and 
increasing levels of semiconductor content in nearly all aspects of the economy.",negative
"We expect Lam’s consistent FOCF generation through industry cycles to enable the company 
to support its long-term capital return targets while maintaining a strong balance sheet.",positive
"We 
anticipate Lam’s FOCF to be at least $3.5 billion in fiscals 2023 and 2024, which we still view as 
sufficient for the company to invest in new and innovative technologies and maintain a strong 
balance sheet, along with maintaining current shareholder return objectives of 75%-100% of 
FOCF.",positive
"Lam has a long track record of conservative balance sheet management and has operated 
in a net cash or near-net cash position through multiple industry cycles.",negative
"Shareholder returns--
including repurchases and dividends--have moderated over the past nine months as industry 
conditions have deteriorated, declining to approximately $1.8 billion compared with 
approximately $3.6 billion in the same period a year prior.",negative
"For fiscals 2023 and 2024, we estimate 
that the company will use 85%-90% of FOCF towards shareholder returns, a slight decline from 
historical levels.",negative
"Its leverage has returned to a near net-cash position as of the March quarter, 
down from 0.3x as of the end of fiscal 2022, and we expect the company to maintain a robust 
balance sheet and see limited risk of sustained leverage increases, even in an industry downturn 
over the next 12 months.",negative
"The extremely high concentration in the semiconductor equipment 
industry also constrains the risk of higher debt in our view as we believe there are few sizable 
acquisition targets that Lam could pursue that would pass regulatory scrutiny.",positive
"Significant consolidation among WFE providers, broader end-market demand for 
semiconductor devices, and an expanding services business will help Lam navigate industry 
cycles.",positive
"Although the company’s acquisition activity has slowed over the past year, significant 
consolidation among chipmakers and foundries over the past decade has given Lam a more 
concentrated customer list but also enabled greater coordination on capital spending and 
longer-term supply agreements.",positive
"Additionally, increasingly diverse end markets for semiconductor 
devices across industrial, automotive, and connectivity applications will reduce industry exposure 
to consumer spending and lowers the probability that all end markets will contract at once.",neutral
"Lam’s 
customer support and services business, which generates revenue from spares, upgrades, and 
nonleading-edge equipment sales (representing about a third of total revenue), provides a more 
stable, recurring source of revenue to offset lumpy equipment orders.",positive
"Nevertheless, we continue 
to view this as one of the more volatile subsectors of the technology industry, and its increasing 
centrality to economic policy and national security concerns clouds our view of the longer-term 
future.",positive
"We believe that although there is a risk that growing trade conflicts and geopolitical concerns 
may increase semiconductor cyclicality in the future, Lam’s strong market position and 
growing services base will enable it to navigate any turbulence.",negative
"The impact of existing trade 
www.spglobal.com/ratingsdirect July 19, 2023       2Lam Research Corp.restrictions on WFE have been fairly limited to date, and the overall impact of recent policy 
actions such as the CHIPs and Science Act has been limited in scale compared with the 
background level of semiconductor capital investment.",negative
"Despite this, we believe that current 
trends toward de-risking supply chains and building more regional supplier networks in the 
semiconductor industry could increase the volatility of future cycles.",positive
"While we believe these 
steps may serve to moderate the impact of a major geopolitical crisis, a less efficient, more 
decoupled foundry network and increasingly government-driven capital spending could magnify 
the more normal volatility of business and inventory cycles.",positive
"Outlook
The stable outlook on Lam reflects our expectation that the company will maintain its 
competitive position in the etch, deposition, and clean product specialty area within the WFE 
industry.",positive
"We also expect Lam will adhere to a consistent financial policy framework whereby it 
maintains a credit cushion against potential industry volatility.",positive
"Downside scenario
We could lower our rating on Lam if: 
•Its financial performance deteriorates materially below our base-case due to end market 
supply-demand imbalances or external shocks like trade conflicts such that its EBITDA and 
FOCF declines, substantially raising S&P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage to above 1.5x; or
•It pursues large, debt-financed acquisitions or shareholder-friendly initiatives that raise S&P 
Global Ratings-adjusted leverage above 1.5x.",positive
"Upside scenario
We would consider upgrading Lam if it: 
•Continues to enhance its competitive position by expanding its market share and product 
portfolio through industry cycles; and2020a 2021a 2022a 2023e 2024e05101520

expanding its addressable market.",neutral
"However, given the semiconductor industry consolidation over 
the past decade, Lam is exposed to high customer concentration, with its top four customers 
accounting for 21% of total revenue in fiscal 2022.",positive
"Lam continues to benefit from capital 
investments in advanced semiconductor processes--particularly extreme ultraviolet patterning 
and gate-all-around--which in turn drive demand for its etch and deposition products.",positive
"While 
memory remains the most cyclical subsector within the semiconductor industry, we believe 
suppliers are mostly disciplined and will adjust investment plans to normalize inventory levels 
and refrain from overinvesting as in previous cycles.",positive
"We forecast this, along with Lam’s recurring 
maintenance and services revenue, will reduce the company’s revenue volatility over the longer 
term.",neutral
"We expect WFE spending will continue to be volatile, as it depends on fab expansions and node 
advancements, both of which could be lumpy and result in revenue and profit fluctuation for Lam 
through industry cycles, as witnessed historically.",neutral
"However, Lam’s strong balance sheet and 
ample liquidity can largely withstand short-term industry corrections.",positive
"Longer term, we expect 
WFE industry growth will exceed that of global GDP because of increasing chip demand and 
steadily rising equipment intensity.",positive

"Lowering FVE to $620
Analyst Note  Abhinav Davuluri, CFA, Sector Strategist, 13 Oct 2022
We are lowering our fair value estimate for wide-moat Lam Research to $620 per share from $720 after 
incorporating recent export restrictions and weaker wafer fab equipment, or WFE, expectations for 2023.",positive
"On Oct. 
12, close peer Applied Materials lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue outlook by $400 million due to the 
latest export restrictions intended to curb China’s chip ambitions and ability to advance its military technology.",positive
"We expect Lam to also be negatively impacted given its dominance in 3D NAND equipment and exposure to 
Yangtze Memory Technologies, or YMTC, China’s NAND champion that is a qualified vendor for 128-layer 3D 
NAND for Apple’s iPhones sold in China.",negative
"We had already reduced our NAND equipment sales outlook for Lam 
stemming from Micron’s recent capital expenditure cuts for its fiscal 2023, but we are further lowering our 2023 
WFE assumptions as TSMC has also cut its capital expenditure budget for 2022 (from $40 billion to $36 billion) 
and is likely to reduce spending in 2023, in our view.",neutral
"While shares of Lam are undervalued at current levels, we 
think market conditions will remain volatile for several quarters as the firm navigates uncertainty related to export 
restrictions and tepid demand in 2023.",negative
"Lam generates about 32% of its sales from China, with roughly half of this revenue derived from domestic 
Chinese chipmakers (and the other half from multi-national customers such as TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix).",negative
This amounts to about $2.6 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022.,neutral
"We assume most of Lam’s equipment sales to 
domestic Chinese chipmakers are for NAND and DRAM, which are likely to be impacted as well given the ban 
includes 128-layer and above 3D NAND and 18-nm and below DRAM.",positive

steps required as a result of major inflections, including FinFET transistors and planar to 3D NAND, that feature 
multiple patterning and vertical layers well suited for Lam's advanced etch and deposition offerings.",positive
"Consequently, Lam is poised to grow faster than the overall equipment industry, as we think it can capture a 
larger share of the market with technically superior tools.",positive
The volatile nature of demand for semiconductors directly affects the cyclicality of the equipment market.,positive
"Lam, 
along with its peers, has benefited from an increase in service revenue in recent years, which we believe will 
mitigate the volatility of equipment orders.",neutral
"Specifically, maintenance and engineering costs and spare parts are 
tied into service contracts, that deliver a stable revenue stream distinct from tool purchases.",positive

nonlitho workarounds, such as multiple patterning that features more advanced etch and deposition tools from 
the likes of AMAT, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron.
From 2014 to 2019, Lam’s end-market exposure was roughly two thirds memory (DRAM and NAND) and one-third 
logic/foundry.",positive
"The introduction of 3D NAND during this time period was a major inflection in flash storage as 
chipmakers scaled vertically to increase capacity (as opposed to solely shrinking feature sizes).",positive
"The increase in 
layer count from first-generation 32 layers to 128 layers more recently has led to significantly greater demand for 
advanced deposition and etch tools from Lam, AMAT, and Tokyo Electron.",positive
"While we still expect the NAND and 
DRAM opportunities for Lam to continue to rise, we don’t think the firm will enjoy the same type of success it did 
during the initial shift from planar to 3D NAND that drove Lam’s top-line growth in fiscal 2017 and 2018 to 36% 
and 38%, respectively.",positive
"We note that memory capital spending has historically been more volatile than logic and foundry capital 
expenditure, as evidenced by the precipitous fall in memory equipment demand in 2019, and Lam’s heavy 
exposure to the memory market and concentration in the competitive etch and deposition markets (relative to 
lithography or process diagnostic control) was a material concern for our assessment of the firm’s economic 
moat.",positive
"Specifically, during bouts of oversupply in the memory space, the market would often find itself in a race to 
the bottom as lower-tier memory chipmakers would struggle financially and larger players could purchase 
equipment and fab space at attractive prices (Micron buying Inotera in 2015, for example).",positive
"Past downturns made 
it difficult for equipment firms to maintain the virtuous cycle of catering to leading-edge chipmakers while 
simultaneously investing in advanced technologies.",negative

chipmakers (leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing is dominated by a smaller cohort that includes Intel, 
Samsung, TSMC, Micron, and SK Hynix, we think the WFE market is now more supportive of maintained and 
resilient excess returns.",positive

Intel, and with the leading chipmaker finally ramping its 10-nm process in earnest in 2019 (along with foundries 
such as TSMC and Samsung also spending heavily), Lam enjoyed growth in its aggregate logic and foundry 
revenue of 76%.",positive
"This helped soften the blow of a weaker memory environment (Lam’s total DRAM and NAND 
sales fell 35%), leading to a roughly even split between memory and logic/foundry sales for Lam in calendar 
2019.",negative
"Going forward, we have greater confidence in Lam’s ability to drive a healthier mix of logic, foundry, and 
memory sales, that we think will allow Lam to bridge the gap in scale with wide-moat Applied Materials.",positive

way for steady growth from wired and wireless infrastructure as well as servers/data centers (cloud buildouts).",positive
"Emerging opportunities involving artificial intelligence, 5G, semi- and fully autonomous vehicles, and the broader 
“Internet of Things” collectively give us confidence in maintained semiconductor demand, especially as these 
broader end markets have more varied performance, efficiency, and connectivity requirements.",positive
"When chipmakers operate numerous fabs around the world, maximizing throughput and reducing process 
variability across their fleet of tools are top priorities.",positive
"We believe incumbent tool providers, such as Lam 
Research, also have intangible assets derived from service contracts and customer collaboration during process 
development and subsequent high-volume manufacturing.",neutral

leverage existing relationships and insights into future customer technology needs to ultimately design and offer 
superior equipment.",positive
"Furthermore, the resultant virtuous cycle cannot easily be replicated by potential new 
entrants.",positive
"Lam’s customer support business group, or CSBG, includes spares, services, upgrades, and its Reliant business 
that helps customers in lagging-edge chip manufacturing refurbish older tools (some having seen 30-plus years 
of service) for applications such as Internet of Things that may not need the high performance often found in a 
PC or iPhone.",positive

recleaning/recoating, repairs, and refurbishments.",negative
"As artificial intelligence progresses, we expect Lam and its 
peers will be able to optimize chamber, tool, and fleet performance leading to less variability, higher yields, and

We view Lam's moat trend as stable.",positive
"We remain positive on the firm's ability to adroitly spend on research and 
development to augment its leadership positions, specifically in dry etch and certain deposition subgroups.",positive
"However, we think various industry dynamics (shift to extreme ultraviolet lithography and away from multiple 
patterning, maturation of 3D NAND, and potential for disruption in traditional chip scaling) better support a 
stable trend rating from our prior view of positive.",positive
"With single-exposure lithography reaching its physical limit, chipmakers have resorted to other methods to 
continue shrinking dimensions along the cadence prescribed by Moore's law.",negative
"Multiple patterning, which involves 
one lithography and multiple deposition and etch steps to define a single layer, has come to the forefront as the 
preferred technique in the cutting-edge technologies.",negative
"As a result, Lam has benefited greatly from the heightened 
requirement for advanced etch and deposition tools.",positive
"However, with EUV finally being inserted into high-volume 
manufacturing at the 7-nanometer process node, we believe chipmakers will be able to return to single 
patterning processes for some layers to simplify the process flow and thus curb the multiple patterning growth 
that Lam, AMAT, and Tokyo Electron have enjoyed in recent years.",positive
"Beyond the overall growth in equipment sold, 
Lam and its peers also benefited from a larger process window and thus more intimate understanding of the 
challenges faced by chipmakers that would create a feedback loop into R&D for future tools.",positive
"To help offset the potential decline in etch and deposition share, Lam has begun pursuing another portion of the 
lithography supply chain: depositing the photoresist in EUV patterning.",neutral
"Tokyo Electron is the current leader in the 
$2 billion conventional wet resist patterning market.",negative
"Lam has been working alongside ASML and the 
Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, a leading semiconductor international research organization, to develop 
dry resist technology that would double Lam’s participation in the EUV process stack while also growing Lam’s 
SAM in resist (which it doesn’t currently serve).",negative
"Management has quantified the revenue opportunity as $1.5 
billion over five years.",neutral
"The 3D NAND inflection in flash storage has also required advanced deposition and etch tools, resulting in 
greater share gains for Lam in recent years and SAM expansion.",positive
"However, following a step function increase in 
spending with the initial transition from planar to 3D NAND, we expect more incremental growth in Lam’s 
addressable markets in memory.",positive
"DRAM also featured some multiple patterning steps (though not as much as 
logic/foundry).",positive
"However, with chipmakers expected to adopt EUV for some process steps in DRAM, Lam’s etch 
and deposition opportunity in DRAM may also begin to plateau.",negative
"By 2023, Lam anticipates another 4% to 8% share growth in both etch and deposition segments by capturing 
share in new critical steps via added capabilities and disrupting existing process steps via enhanced productivity.",positive
"Management estimates that Lam’s served addressable market will be above 40% of WFE by 2023, underscoring 
its expectations for its core end markets and new opportunities.",positive
"In dry etch, Lam has been the clear leader for the 
past 20 years, and we expect it to extend this leadership with its latest Sense.i etch tool for both advanced 
memory and logic.",positive

Recent Analyst Notes
Lam Shrugs Off Micron’s Capital Expenditure Cut Plans with Strong Q4 Results and Q1 Outlook  Abhinav 
Davuluri, CFA, Sector Strategist, 27 Jul 2022
Wide-moat Lam Research reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that came in ahead of our expectations.",positive
"We note 
Lam and its peers have been dealing with supply chain constraints that have prevented equipment suppliers from 
fulfilling robust wafer fab equipment, or WFE, demand.",neutral
"Although Micron recently lowered its capital-expenditure 
outlook, Lam has benefited from greater exposure to foundry and logic chipmakers such as TSMC and Intel.",positive
"Despite weaker PC and smartphone demand, Lam provided strong September quarter guidance, which we 
attribute to unfulfilled demand at logic/foundry customers.",positive
"Looking ahead, we think WFE levels are likely to 
decline in 2023 mainly due to weaker memory capital expenditure spending.",negative
"Our $720 fair value estimate is 
intact, and we think prospective investors should find current levels attractive based on Lam’s favorable long-
term prospects.",positive
June quarter sales were up 12% year over year and 14% sequentially to $4.6 billion.,neutral
"Sequential increases in 
NAND, logic, and foundry equipment sales were partially offset by a decline in DRAM.",negative
"We expect logic and 
foundry equipment revenue to improve in the coming quarters to support robust investment plans from the likes 
of Intel and TSMC.",neutral
Services revenue was up 18% year over year.,neutral
"We believe this sticky business has proven 
instrumental in mitigating the volatility in Lam’s results, relative to past down cycles, and is critical during the 
ongoing chip shortage as we expect customers are upgrading existing capacity to improve productivity.",negative
"Gross 
margins rose 60 basis points sequentially to 45.3% due to improved execution as Lam deals with broad-based 
inflation in its supply chain.",positive
Fiscal 2022 revenue rose 18% to $17.2 billion.,positive
"We were impressed with Lam’s full-year logic sales that more than 
doubled year over year to $1.6 billion, which we attribute to share gains for Lam’s etch tools in Intel’s latest 
process technologies.",positive
Management expects September quarter revenue to be at a midpoint of $4.9 billion.,neutral
"March Quarter Supply Chain Woes Don’t Constrain Our Long-Term Optimism for Wide-Moat Lam Research  
Abhinav Davuluri, CFA, Sector Strategist, 21 Apr 2022
Wide-moat Lam Research reported fiscal third-quarter results that came in below our expectations and the 
midpoint of management's guidance due to delays in system components and broad supply chain hurdles.",negative
"Nonetheless, management remained confident that equipment demand is still robust and anticipates calendar 
2022 wafer fab equipment, or WFE, spending of around $100 billion, which is consistent with our estimates.",positive
"Supporting this growth in WFE are large 2022 capital expenditure budgets from TSMC ($44 billion) and Intel ($27 
billion).",positive
"Although Lam has historically had greater exposure to memory end markets, we think it has improved its 
foundry and logic design wins in recent years sufficiently to achieve healthy growth in 2022 once it is able to 
overcome supply chain headwinds.",positive
"Our $720 fair value estimate remains intact, and we think prospective 
investors should find current levels attractive, particularly amidst the recent sell-off in technology stocks.",positive

"Lam Not Immune to Chip Shortage for Its Own Chipmaking Equipment in Fiscal Q2; Shares Undervalued  
Abhinav Davuluri, CFA, Sector Strategist, 27 Jan 2022
Wide-moat Lam Research reported fiscal second-quarter results that came in below our expectations and the 
midpoint of management's guidance due to delays in system components and broad supply chain hurdles, similar 
to equipment peer ASML.",positive
"Due to the component delays, December quarter sales fell short by more than $200

Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Overview
At the heart  of our valuation  system  is a detailed  projec-
tion of a company’s  future  cash  flows,  resulting  from  our 
analysts’  research.",positive
"Analysts  create  custom  industry  and 
company  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-
ally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or 
DCF,  modeling  templates.",neutral
"We use scenario  analysis,  inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical  tools  to augment  this process.",negative
"Moreover,  we 
think  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows 
presents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, 
high-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., 
mines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative 
earnings  over the next few years.",negative
"That said,  we don’t  dis-
miss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-
ing cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates.",positive
"We also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own 
challenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-
ated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss 
shortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these 
negatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our 
longterm approach.",positive
"Morningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-
lieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the 
future cash flows it can generate.",positive
"The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-
um to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in 
Morningstar  terminology.",positive
"Five-star  stocks  sell for the 
biggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.",positive
"Four key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our 
assessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate 
of the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that 
fair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.",positive
"This 
process  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-
ing.",neutral
1.,neutral
"Economic Moat
The concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not 
only in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term 
investment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of 
our fair value  estimates.",positive
"An economic  moat  is a structural 
feature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.",negative
"We define  economic  profits  as re-
turns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-
timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average 
cost of capital  (or WACC).",negative
"Without  a moat,  profits  are 
more  susceptible  to competition.",positive
"We have  identified  five 
sources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",positive
"Companies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are 
more  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns 
for at least  the next 10 years.",neutral
"Wide-moat  companies  are 
those  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess 
returns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more 
likely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.",positive
"The longer 
a firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic 
value.",positive
"We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will 
see their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",positive
"When  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess 
whether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, 
stemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, 
financial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.",negative
"In this con-
text, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its 
occurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a 
cumulative  or midcycle  basis.",negative
"If we deem  the probability 
of occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize 
the company as possessing an economic moat.",positive
"To assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts 
perform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.",neutral
"A firm’s 
moat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources 
of competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable 
where  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-
vantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when 
we see signs of deterioration.",negative
2.,neutral
"Estimated Fair Value
Combining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the 
firm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns 
on invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of 
capital.",positive
"Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-
ing are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a 
longer  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat 
firms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-
creasing  our estimate  of their  intrinsic  value.",positive
Our model  is divided into three distinct stages:,positive
"Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts 
make  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items 
such  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in 
workingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.",positive
"Based  on 
these  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, 
after  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.",positive
Stage II:,neutral
"Fade
The second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take 
the company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-
turn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to 
decline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.",positive
"During  the Stage  II 
period,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in 
lieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I.",negative
"The 
length  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of 
the company’s  economic  moat.",positive
"We forecast  this period  to 
last anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-
nomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-
panies).",positive
"During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using 
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on 
new invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years 
until  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.",negative
"The invest-
ment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-
til a perpetuity  value  is calculated.",positive
"In the case  of firms 
that do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal 
ROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-
able  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the 
second stage.",negative
Stage III:,neutral
"Perpetuity
Once  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-
petuity  formula.",neutral
"At perpetuity,  we assume  that any 
growth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither 
creates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.",positive
"Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash 
flows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present 
value  of expected  future  cash  flows.",positive
"Because  we are 
modeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash 
available  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we 
discount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a 
weighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-
ferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-
pected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value 
weights.",positive

internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have

fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns.",positive

obligation is also impacted by acquisitions.",neutral
"Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued
each period based on the period end exchange rates.",negative

corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the
agreement is renewed.",positive
"Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending
renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer.",positive

delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining
performance obligation.",positive

"Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be
accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.",positive
Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately.,positive
"In determining whether professional services are
distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the

We primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan.",positive
"The
expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets.",negative
"This exposure is
the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party
infrastructure providers, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency.",negative

the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that

in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates.",negative

"References to fiscal 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.",neutral
"Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.",neutral
"Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:
•the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;
•the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;
•the valuation of privately-held strategic investments, including impairments;
•the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;
•the average period of benefit associated with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts;
•the useful lives of intangible assets; and
•the fair value of certain stock awards issued.",positive
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.,neutral

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.",neutral
"All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",positive

the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in
various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market.",negative
"While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market
segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in one operating
segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Customer 360 Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the
Company’s CODM evaluates the Company’s financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated
basis.",positive
"In January 2023, former co-CEO and Vice Chair of the Company’s Board of Directors, Bret Taylor, resigned his positions from the Company.",neutral

Benioff assumed all Mr. Taylor’s responsibilities and, as of January, 31 2023, is the primary executive that evaluates the operating results of the Company

"Accordingly, the Company determined that the chief executive officer also serves as the CODM for the
purposes of segment reporting.",neutral
"Despite the change in the chief operating decision maker, the Company determined no change to
65Table of Contents
segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components of the Company for which separate financial information is regularly
evaluated.",neutral
"Concentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and accounts receivable.",positive

due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns.",positive
"The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the
consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date.",negative

allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.",neutral

United States were 83 percent and 86 percent of total assets, respectively.",neutral

"Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and professional services and other revenues.",negative
"Subscription
and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud
Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term and perpetual licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the
basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses.",neutral
"Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for
process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.",positive
"Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the
Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.",neutral
"If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for
example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total
transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.",positive
"The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•determination of the transaction price;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.",neutral
"Subscription and Support Revenues
Subscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related
support and updates during the term of the arrangement.",neutral
Cloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software.,neutral
"Revenue is generally
recognized ratably over the contract term.",positive
"Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain
refund-type provisions.",neutral
"Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term and perpetual software licenses that provide the customer with a right
to use the software as it exists when made available.",positive
"Revenues from term and perpetual
66Table of Contents
software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer.",positive
"Revenue from software support and
updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term.",positive
The Company typically invoices its customers annually and its payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice.,negative
"Amounts that
have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has
occurred.",neutral
"Professional Services and Other Revenues
The Company’s professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed price or subscription basis.",positive
"These revenues are recognized
as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract
term for subscription professional services contracts.",positive
Other revenues consist primarily of training revenues recognized as such services are performed.,positive
Significant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations,positive
"The Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple performance obligations such as Cloud
Services, software licenses, support and updates and professional services.",positive
"A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer
products or services that are concluded to be distinct.",positive
"Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be
accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.",positive
"Cloud Services, software licenses and support and updates services are generally concluded to be distinct because such offerings are often sold
separately.",positive
"In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services
agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract
was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional
services work.",positive
"To date, the Company has concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.",positive
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis.,neutral
"The SSP is the price at which the Company
would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer.",neutral
Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.,positive
The Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions.,neutral
"Significant pricing practices taken into
consideration include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the
geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company's go-to-market strategy, historical and current sales and contract prices.",positive
"In instances
where the Company does not sell or price a product or service separately, the Company determines SSP using information that may include market
conditions or other observable inputs.",negative
"As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future,
which could result in changes to SSP.",neutral
"In certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold or priced separately in comparable
circumstances to similar customers.",positive
The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when indicated by the distribution of its observable prices.,negative
"Alternatively, the Company uses a range of amounts to estimate SSP when the pricing practices or distribution of the observable prices is highly
variable.",positive
"The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by
customer size and geography.",positive
Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts,neutral
"The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts related to non-cancelable Cloud Services subscription, ongoing Cloud
Services support and license support and updates.",neutral
"For contracts with on-premises software licenses where revenue is recognized upfront when the
software is made available to the customer, costs allocable to those licenses are expensed as they are incurred.",positive
"Capitalized amounts consist primarily of
sales commissions paid to the Company’s direct sales force.",positive
"Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales
force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees
upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the
Company’s employees and (4) to a lesser extent, success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence.",positive
"Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which is longer than the typical initial
contract period, but reflects the estimated average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals.",negative
"In arriving at this average period of benefit, the
Company evaluated both qualitative and quantitative factors which
67Table of Contents
included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition.",negative
"Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and
success fees paid to partners over two years.",positive
The capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all non-cancelable customer contracts.,neutral
"The Company periodically
evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its
amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment.",negative
"Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.",neutral
There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2023 and 2022.,neutral
"Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.",positive
"Cash and
cash equivalents are stated at fair value.",positive
"Marketable Securities
The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond
one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.",positive
"Securities are classified as available for sale and
are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income until realized.",positive
"Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable,
such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.",positive
"Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine
what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses.",positive
"Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other expense, net on the
consolidated statements of operations, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders' equity.",negative
"For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-
identification method.",neutral
"Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other expense on the
consolidated statements of operations.",positive
"Strategic Investments
The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company
does not have a controlling interest.",neutral
"Privately held equity securities where the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in but does exercise significant influence over the
investee are accounted for under the equity method.",positive
"Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and
adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative).",neutral
"All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net on the
consolidated statements of operations.",neutral
"Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated
other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet.",positive
Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data.,negative
"The carrying
value is not adjusted for the Company's privately held equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the
same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below.",neutral
"In determining the
estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company.",positive
"The
Company assesses its privately held debt and equity securities in its strategic investment portfolio at least quarterly for impairment.",negative
"The Company’s
impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance
of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash.",neutral
"If the investment is considered impaired, the Company
recognizes an impairment through the consolidated statements of operations and establishes a new carrying value for the investment.",positive
"Publicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through gains on strategic investments, net on the consolidated
statements of operations.",positive
The Company may enter into strategic investments or other investments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”).,negative
"If the Company is a
primary beneficiary of a VIE, it is required to consolidate the entity.",positive
"To determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company
evaluates whether it has (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.",positive
"The assessment of whether the Company is the
primary beneficiary of its VIE investments requires significant assumptions and judgments.",positive
"VIEs that are not consolidated are
68Table of Contents
accounted for under the measurement alternative, equity method, amortized cost, or other appropriate methodology based on the nature of the interest
held.",positive
"Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative
contracts at fair value.",positive
"In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt securities and privately
held equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security.",positive
"The additional
disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are included in Note 4 “Fair Value Measurement.”",positive
"Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk associated with
intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary.",negative
"The
Company uses forward currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances
primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen.",positive
"The Company’s
derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.",neutral
"The Company generally enters into master netting
arrangements with the financial institutions with which it contracts for such derivatives, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same
counterparty, thereby reducing risk of credit-related losses from a financial institutions' nonperformance.",positive
"While the contract or notional amount is often
used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if
any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.",negative
"The notional amount of
foreign currency derivative contracts as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 was $6.0 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively.",negative
Outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.,positive
"Unrealized gains or
losses due to changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts, as well as realized gains or losses from their net settlement, are recognized as other
expense consistent with the offsetting gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement or settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated
receivables and payables.",positive
"Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.",negative
"Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of those assets as follows:
Buildings and building improvements 10 to 40 years
Computers, equipment and software 3 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years",positive
"The Company estimates the useful lives of property and equipment upon initial recognition and periodically evaluates the useful lives and whether
events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the useful lives.",positive
"When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective
accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.",neutral
"Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and classifies its leases at commencement.",neutral
"Operating leases are included in
operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.",neutral
"Assets
recognized from finance leases (also referred to as ROU assets) are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities and other
noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.",negative
"ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset
for the lease term.",positive
The corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.,neutral
"The Company does not
recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less for any asset classes.",negative
"Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement, net of any
future tenant incentives.",neutral
"The Company has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to combine for all
asset classes.",neutral
"As such, minimum lease payments include fixed payments for non-lease components within a lease agreement, but exclude variable lease
payments not dependent on an index or rate, such as common area maintenance, operating expenses, utilities, or other costs that are subject to fluctuation
from period to period.",negative
The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.,neutral
"Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the
lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the
69Table of Contents
associated extension option or waive the termination option.",positive
"The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in
circumstances occurs within the control of the Company.",positive
"As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future
minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.",positive
"The Company's incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of
the interest rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where
the leased asset is located.",positive
"The lease ROU asset is recognized based on the lease liability, adjusted for any rent payments or initial direct costs incurred or tenant incentives
received prior to commencement.",positive
"Lease expenses for minimum lease payments for operating leases, which includes amortization expense of ROU assets, are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.",neutral
"Amortization expense of finance lease ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and
interest expense for finance lease liabilities is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.",neutral
"Expense for variable lease payments are recognized as
incurred.",neutral
"On the lease commencement date, the Company also establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-
lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease.",negative
"Such assets are included in property and equipment, net and are amortized over the lease term to
operating expense.",neutral
The Company has entered into subleases or has made decisions and taken actions to exit and sublease certain unoccupied leased office space.,positive
"Similar to other long-lived assets discussed below, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.",negative
"For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility
prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.",neutral
"Intangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.",positive

intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.",positive
"Management tests for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.",neutral
"Impairment Assessment
The Company evaluates intangible assets and other long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.",negative
"This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market
conditions or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.",positive
"Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the
carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate.",negative
"If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for
recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.",positive

Salesforce delivered an epic quarter in what we believe is truly a seminal moment within its lifecycle.,positive

fourth quarter, the company delivered substantial upside to both revenue and profitability, which is an impressive 
achievement.",positive
"However, the company’s pivot toward profitability over the next two years was well beyond our 
expectations.",neutral

$10 billion previously, while also disbanding its mergers and acquisitions committee as the company focuses on 
organic growth.",negative

to $245 per share from $220.",positive
"Shares look attractive even after an aftermarket pop, and the stock remain one of 
our top picks.",positive
"Revenue grew 14% year over year (17% in constant currency) to $8.384 billion, compared with the high end of 
guidance of $8.032 billion.",positive
"Both MuleSoft and Tableau license deals were strong in the quarter, which drove 
abnormal upside given the license model that is more prominent in those units and sees immediate revenue 
recognition.",positive
"Current remaining performance obligations, or CRPO, grew 13% year over year in constant currency, 
which continues to lag revenue growth.",neutral
"The demand environment remains challenging, with small business 
notably weaker but vertical solutions stronger.",positive
"Management noted eight of the company’s 13 cloud products had 
annual recurring revenue, or ARR, year-over-year growth of 50% or more.",positive

revenue outlook for the quarter was better than we expected, while the full-year figure was slightly less than we 
anticipated.",positive
"Profitability, however, was much better than we had modeled.",positive

boosted its formal margin guidance to 27% in fiscal 2024, but also previewed that they expect the company to hit 
30% non-GAAP operating margins early in fiscal 2025.",positive
"Both margins would be well above the company’s goal 
from just a few months ago of hitting 25% in fiscal 2026.",negative
We see the fingerprints of multiple activist shareholders all over the company’s results and guidance.,neutral
"The 
acceleration of margin improvement, the stressing of profitability on the earnings call, the expanded share 
buyback authorization, the slowdown in stock-based compensation in the future, the disbanding of the M&A 
committee, and the new board members are likely all the result of the multiple activist shareholders that have 
taken a stake in Salesforce over the last several months.",positive

for years that Salesforce generates substandard margins and has placed too much emphasis on acquisitions.",positive

"We believe Salesforce represents one of best long-term investment opportunities in software, particularly as the 
company should provide investors with a nice balance between revenue growth and improving profitability.",positive

as revenue growth has decelerated over time, we believe a new focus on margin expansion should continue to

modest revenue acceleration after depressed growth in both fiscal 2023 and 2024.",positive
"We forecast non-GAAP 
operating margin expanding from 23% in fiscal 2023 (actual) to the low 30% area in fiscal 2028, which we think is 
consistent with management’s new profitability focus.",positive
We believe the underlying markets are large and growing.,positive
"According to management, the total addressable 
market will grow to $248 billion by 2025, with compound annual growth rates for the markets served by 
Salesforce’s various clouds generally ranging from 12% to 20%.",positive

"For Salesforce.com overall, we assign a wide moat rating arising primarily from switching costs, with support 
from a network effect as well.",positive
"Salesforce.com revolutionized the software industry in 2000 with the release of its salesforce automation, or SFA, 
application.",neutral
"The feature set was generally similar to those offered by peers: streamlined process management for 
sales leads and opportunities, contact and account data, process tracking, approvals, and territory tracking.",neutral
"Salesforce.com’s critical differentiator was that the software was accessed through a web browser and delivered 
over the internet.",neutral
"Taken for granted now, this was a novel concept during the internet bubble.",neutral
"The company 
paved the way for the software industry as it exists now by first selling the concept of software as a service to 
prospective customers and then selling the actual SFA product.",positive
"The SaaS business model, and Salesforce's SFA application, rose in popularity as customers were able to avoid 
high up-front costs and lengthy installations or potentially painful upgrade cycles, were always running the latest 
version, had more predictable operating expenses and capital outlays, and were running modern best-of-breed 
applications.",positive
"Further, the SaaS vendors benefited from more predictable revenue streams, the elimination of 
piracy, and supporting only one product version.",positive
"Thus, a new way to consume software was born, with all parties 
benefiting.",positive
Salesforce.com remains the clear leader in salesforce automation (Sales Cloud).,positive
"The company has gone from no 
product to 33% market share over the last 20 years.",neutral
"Customers and industry observers alike view Salesforce.com 
as the clear front-runner in a category that increases the productivity of sales representatives.",positive
"In other words, 
this is mission-critical software that helps drive revenue for users.",negative
"We believe this segment enjoys a wide moat--
indeed the widest moat as a stand-alone product among Salesforce.com’s four cloud solutions.",negative
"A variety of 
industry data points clearly indicate the Sales Cloud SFA solution is a best-of-breed solution, which by itself 
creates a certain amount of organizational inertia, as IT managers and executives engage in self-serving behavior.",positive
"That is, they can jeopardize their own careers by pushing to switch from a leading solution that is functioning 
well and meeting their corporate needs.",positive
"We believe customers are also reluctant to switch away from Sales 
Cloud because of the time, expense, and risk of implementing new applications and migrating data and the time, 
expense, and lost productivity of retraining the workforce on a new platform.",positive
"SFA is a revenue-driving initiative 
and therefore is critical to users.",neutral
"The organizational risk of making a change is high, in our view.",positive
There is a school of thought that asserts switching costs are lower on SaaS software solutions.,neutral
"We do not 
subscribe to that position.",neutral
"While it may be easier to physically switch from one vendor to another in a SaaS 
model, the data generally do not show increased churn as the industry has shifted from on-premises perpetual 
licenses to cloud-delivered SaaS solutions.",negative
"We attribute the lack of customer churn in SaaS in general to easier 
integration with existing applications and infrastructure, best-of-breed solutions, the time, expense, and risk of 
moving mission-critical data, and the retraining of the workforce to learn a new application.",positive
"We think these same 
considerations drive highly recurring revenue for Salesforce.com.",positive

Salesforce is generally considered a leader in each.,positive

Salesforce.com enjoys a wide moat based on switching costs here as well for the same reasons as its SFA 
offering.",negative

converting a critical revenue-driving function from one application to another, including the implementation and 
retraining of the workforce, in our view.",neutral
"We think the organizational risk is high for the revenue-driving function 
that Service Cloud covers.",positive
It is more expensive to find a new customer than it is to retain an existing customer.,positive

underlying size of each offering.",neutral
"As a business segment, it is the company’s smallest and represents 15% of

campaigns to targeted audiences, and by itself represents another natural extension of SFA.",positive
"While we do not see 
Commerce Cloud as a clear add-on to SFA, we do see a more obvious relation to Marketing, as it enables an e-
commerce engine driven by data and analytics.",positive

marketing campaigns more quickly, and improve e-commerce site traffic.",positive

naturally in that it helps customers solve a major pain point: integrating data and applications across platforms.",positive

"Application 
development platforms are sticky in that they serve as the core platform on which businesses and processes are 
built, and switching could be highly disruptive and expensive for developers.",negative
"The company was early to the 
market with a cloud-based application development platform for customers.",positive
"Use of the platform provided the 
low-investment benefits of a SaaS product, allowed for immediate and smooth integration with Salesforce.com’s 
solutions, and also allowed developers to sell (or give away) the applications they developed on the company’s 
AppExchange.",positive
"The AppExchange was not just a novel concept at the time (it predated Apple’s App Store by two years), it was 
revolutionary and by itself was very enticing to developers.",positive
"A variety of publicly traded companies started out as 
apps developed on the platform and initially distributed on the AppExchange.",positive
"In the early years, the popularity of 
the SFA product attracted developers, Salesforce.com provided a robust and easy-to-use application development 
platform, and developers created additional applications often built as add-ons to various Salesforce.com 
solutions.",positive
We believe these dynamics allow Salesforce to continue to benefit from network effects.,neutral
"That is, as 
more customers adopt any of the company’s solutions, the AppExchange provides an ever-expanding audience, 
which makes the AppExchange incrementally more attractive to developers, thus perpetuating a virtuous cycle.",positive
"In our opinion, the strength of these clouds is important but should not overshadow the importance of all the 
solutions being offered under one umbrella by Salesforce.",positive
"We believe customers value Salesforce.com’s discrete 
clouds as stand-alone solutions, but the various clouds are highly complementary and are tightly integrated with 
one another, making the complete set of solutions more compelling.",positive

vendors.",neutral

solutions lead to higher switching costs and an increasing network effect.",positive

is allocated across multiple clouds has increased in each of the last two years, indicating that customers are 
becoming even more entrenched in Salesforce's solutions.",positive
"At this point, the company’s dominance in SFA is obvious.",neutral
"We hesitate to label this a mature market, but it is the 
most mature opportunity the company is pursuing.",positive
"This is why investing in the other clouds over the last 10 years 
has been so critical.",negative
"Rather than waiting for growth to slow in its core SFA product, Salesforce.com has been 
seeding and investing in these areas for the last decade.",negative
"The SFA solution on its own may not be increasing its 
lead, but by virtue of offering additional directly related strong offerings, we assert that the SFA product is 
increasingly attractive to customers.",positive

trend, as switching costs are increasing.",positive

believe that Service Cloud on its own is a very strong product and receives consideration from any customers 
looking to invest in a customer engagement suite.",positive
"In our view, the company’s offering and market position are 
simply that strong.",positive
"Further, the combination of Service Cloud with either the dominant SFA product or a leading 
and robust marketing suite makes for a very compelling combination of solutions.",positive
"Marketing Cloud is experiencing a positive moat trend, in our opinion.",positive
"We believe feature-driven acquisitions are 
making the company’s already strong platform more robust and are thus driving switching costs up.",positive
"Beyond the 
Marketing Cloud itself, we again argue that dominant offerings in directly related areas for SFA and customer 
engagement make for a natural cross-selling opportunity.",positive
We believe the moat trend for Commerce Cloud is positive.,positive

it was acquired.",positive

they sought to better understand how Demandware was going to be integrated and what the product roadmap 
will look like.",positive
"After nearly three years, we believe any initial trepidation has subsided and the benefits of 
including a commerce engine in Salesforce.com’s broader customer experience platform provides a more robust 
solution and compelling value proposition.",positive
"We believe the moat trend for Salesforce's Platform and other business segment is positive, with both switching 
costs and the network effect strengthening.",positive
"The Salesforce Platform is a robust offering but the AppExchange 
created something unique for developers and Salesforce.com customers alike.",positive

network effect is self-maintaining where the developers are attracted to the tools and the audience, and 
Salesforce customers are attracted to the core products and the add-ons.",neutral

Recent Analyst Notes
Strong Profitability for Salesforce, but Demand Environment Is Not Improving; FVE Cut to $220  Dan 
Romanoff,Senior Equity Analyst,1 Dec 2022
For its fiscal third quarter, Salesforce delivered modest upside relative to our revenue expectations and more 
meaningfully outperformed our margin estimate despite foreign currency headwinds that continue to worsen.",positive
"Fiscal fourth-quarter guidance, however, was slightly shy of our model.",negative
"Sales cycle elongation and deal size 
compression that began in July intensified this quarter, while management commented they expect these 
conditions to persist into next year.",neutral
"We lowered our estimates for fiscal 2024 in anticipation of a persistently 
challenging macro environment and then also made some minor related smoothing adjustments to our model.",positive
"As 
a result, we are lowering our fair value estimate for wide-moat Salesforce to $220, from $240 previously.",positive
"On the 
positive side, management stated the firm continues to build a healthy sales pipeline, and the company bought 
back 11 million shares for $1.7 billion.",positive
"Salesforce remains one of our top software picks and we applaud the 
company’s increasing focus on margins along with the newly implemented $10 billion buyback 
program.",positive
Salesforce also announced co-CEO Bret Taylor was leaving the company.,neutral
"We believe Salesforce has a 
deep bench given global operations, a massive sales organization, a leading engineering team, and a variety of 
leaders from acquired companies that the firm could elevate should it feel the need to do so.",negative
"In the meantime, 
founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff remains at the helm, so there is little immediate change other than Salesforce 
once again does not have an immediate succession plan.",negative
"Revenue grew 14% year over year (19% in constant 
currency) to $7.84 billion, compared with FactSet consensus of $7.83 billion.",neutral
"Current remaining performance 
obligations, or CRPO, grew 15% year over year in constant currency, which lagged revenue growth for the fifth 
straight quarter, and further supports our downward estimate revisions.",positive
"A previous version of this note was 
published with the incorrect name of the co-CEO.",negative
"Genie Out of the Bottle; Salesforce Throws a Margin Gauntlet Down; FVE Steady at $240  Dan Romanoff,Senior 
Equity Analyst,22 Sep 2022",positive
"The biggest investor news from wide-moat Salesforce’s investor day was the reiteration of full-year guidance of 
$31 billion at the high end for fiscal 2023; the reiteration of $50 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026—despite a $2 
billion headwind from foreign exchange over the last year; and the new long-term guidepost for 25% or higher 
non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2026.",positive
"Along with several other product announcements, the company also 
introduced Genie, a new customer data platform to infuse real-time data across clouds.",positive
"Lastly, Salesforce also 
provided an updated capital allocation strategy, a current total addressable market, or TAM, analysis, and 
incremental disclosures around contract length, cloud uptake, cohort analysis, and retention.",neutral
"We continue to 
view the stock as one of our top picks, maintain our fair value estimate of $240 per share, and see shares as 
attractive.",positive
"Tactically, management noted that the demand environment remains healthy and pipeline generation 
has been good—deals are still being seen and the cost of new technology is being scrutinized, but revenue Morningstar Equity Company Report | Report as of 2 Mar 2023 04:19, UTC | Reporting Currency: USD | Trading Currency: USD | Exchange: NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC. Page 20 of 27

company  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-
ally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or 
DCF,  modeling  templates.",neutral
"We use scenario  analysis,  inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical  tools  to augment  this process.",negative

think  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows 
presents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, 
high-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., 
mines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative 
earnings  over the next few years.",negative
"That said,  we don’t  dis-
miss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-
ing cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates.",positive
"We also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own 
challenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-
ated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss 
shortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these 
negatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our 
longterm approach.",positive
"Morningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-
lieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the 
future cash flows it can generate.",positive
"The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-
um to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in 
Morningstar  terminology.",positive
"Five-star  stocks  sell for the 
biggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.",positive
"Four key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our 
assessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate 
of the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that 
fair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.",positive

process  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-
ing.",neutral

"Economic Moat
The concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not 
only in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term 
investment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of 
our fair value  estimates.",positive
"An economic  moat  is a structural 
feature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.",negative
"We define  economic  profits  as re-
turns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-
timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average 
cost of capital  (or WACC).",negative
"Without  a moat,  profits  are 
more  susceptible  to competition.",positive
"We have  identified  five 
sources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",positive
"Companies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are 
more  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns 
for at least  the next 10 years.",neutral
"Wide-moat  companies  are 
those  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess 
returns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more 
likely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.",positive
"The longer 
a firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic 
value.",positive
"We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will 
see their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",positive
"When  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess 
whether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, 
stemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, 
financial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.",negative
"In this con-
text, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its 
occurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a 
cumulative  or midcycle  basis.",negative
"If we deem  the probability 
of occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize 
the company as possessing an economic moat.",positive
"To assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts 
perform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.",neutral
"A firm’s 
moat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources 
of competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable 
where  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-
vantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when 
we see signs of deterioration.",negative
2.,neutral
"Estimated Fair Value
Combining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the 
firm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns 
on invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of 
capital.",positive
"Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-
ing are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a 
longer  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat 
firms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.",positive

"Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts

such  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in 
workingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.",positive
"Based  on 
these  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, 
after  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.",positive
Stage II:,neutral
"Fade
The second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take 
the company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-
turn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to 
decline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.",positive
"During  the Stage  II 
period,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in 
lieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I.",negative
"The 
length  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of 
the company’s  economic  moat.",positive
"We forecast  this period  to 
last anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-
nomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-
panies).",positive
"During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using 
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on 
new invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years 
until  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.",negative
"The invest-
ment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-
til a perpetuity  value  is calculated.",positive
"In the case  of firms 
that do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal 
ROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-
able  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the 
second stage.",negative
Stage III:,neutral
"Perpetuity
Once  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-
petuity  formula.",neutral
"At perpetuity,  we assume  that any 
growth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither 
creates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.",positive
"Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash 
flows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present 
value  of expected  future  cash  flows.",positive
"Because  we are 
modeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash 
available  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we 
discount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a 
weighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-
ferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-
pected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value 
weights.",positive

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Once  we determine  the fair value  estimate  of a stock,  we 
compare  it with  the stock’s  current  market  price  on a 
daily  basis,  and the star rating  is automatically  re-calcu-
lated  at the market  close  on every  day the market  on 
which  the stock  is listed  is open.",positive

tabs on the companies  they follow,  and, based  on thor-

estimates as warranted.",positive

fluctuate  daily,  so the star ratings,  in the aggregate,  can 
serve  as a gauge  of the broader  market’s  valuation.",neutral
"When  there  are many  5-star  stocks,  the stock  market  as a 
whole  is more  undervalued,  in our opinion,  than  when 
very few companies garner our highest rating.",positive

market  price  will converge  on our fair value  estimate  over time  generally  within  three  years  (although  it is im-
possible  to predict  the exact  time frame  in which  market 
prices may adjust).",positive

Analyst Note  Nicolas Owens, Equity Analyst,",positive
"25 Jan 2023
Boeing closed 2022 on a positive note, with two important pieces of news lifting some uncertainty over its path 
to recovery.",positive
"We are maintaining our $220 per share fair value estimate, though we may revisit some valuation 
details after Boeing files its 10-K statement.",positive
"In December, the U.S. Congress included a provision in the omnibus spending bill to extend the deadline for the 
FAA to continue to work with Boeing to certify its new 737 Max-7 and MAX-10 plane designs based on the 
original application, which should allow Boeing to continue producing a cockpit operational design and pilot 
feedback mechanisms consistent with other 737s in the air today, albeit with some software updates that will be 
applied to the rest of the fleet over the next few years.",positive
"Hundreds of these planes are already on order (many 
MAX-7s would be destined for the Southwest fleet), and the company lobbied for the FAA extension on the 
grounds that having a different cockpit design could confuse pilots, require multiple costly training regimes, and 
ultimately jeopardize passenger safety.",positive
"The other cloud that lifted was the return of 737 MAX jets to active flights service in China (coincident with the 
lifting of severe zero-COVID-19 travel restrictions in that country).",negative
"Domestic air travel in China alone accounts for 
approximately one sixth of global traffic (in normal times), and about one fifth of aircraft deliveries before the 
pandemic were destined for China.",negative
"Thus, the line of sight for Boeing to be able to deliver hundreds of planes to 
Chinese airline customers is welcome news—we had assumed it would happen but weren't sure when.",positive

20 years with the rise of low-cost carriers and middle-class consumers in emerging markets.",negative
"Boeing's narrow-body business was severely battered by the extended grounding of its 737 MAX due to two fatal 
crashes of the plane before the COVID-19 pandemic.",negative
"The pandemic cut air travel by two thirds between 2019 and 
2020, and Boeing's primary competitor, Airbus, saw a one-third drop in airplane deliveries while Boeing had to 
cease deliveries of its workhorse plane entirely for 20 months to rework the navigation and other systems on

Chinese carriers will take up to a quarter of new airplanes in the next decade.",negative
"We expect wide-body demand to take longer to recover from the pandemic than narrow-body demand because 
wide-bodies are used for longer and international trips, which are bouncing back slower than domestic routes.",neutral

of deliveries and eventually margins on its bread and butter 737 and 787 models.",positive
"The COVID-19 crisis shocked the aviation industry and essentially halved global revenue passenger kilometers in 
2020.",negative
"Beyond the pandemic, and lingering manufacturing headaches, we assume robust revenue passenger 
kilometer growth, as we expect GDP growth will drive above-GDP RPK growth, especially in emerging markets.",neutral
"We assume a replacement cycle among most airlines will take place, and that the vast majority of fleet growth 
will be from narrow-body aircraft as an emerging market middle class demands more short-haul and point-to-
point medium-haul travel.",positive
"We expect that mix shift toward the high-margin 737 MAX and eventual returns to learning-curve-based cost 
efficiencies should help the company improve margins.",neutral

commercial airplane market is large enough and so difficult to break into that it supports two wide-moat aircraft 
manufacturers.",negative

higher exposure to fixed-price contracts, but we think the firm is turning a corner operationally and benefits from 
intangible assets stemming from the technical complexity of its products as well as switching costs from the time 
and effort the military faces to switch suppliers as well as a lack of viable alternative suppliers.",positive
"We think Boeing 
global services possesses intangible assets from proprietary access to aftermarket part designs as the Federal 
Aviation Administration and other regulators require that spare parts be identical to the original design, as well 
as benefiting from switching costs stemming from a lack of alternative suppliers for such parts.",positive
"In the commercial aircraft manufacturing segment, we believe the technical complexity of aircraft manufacturing 
and the extensive regulatory barriers to entering the market constitute wide-moat-caliber intangible assets.",neutral
"Both 
Boeing and Airbus benefit from these barriers to entry and it means they operate in a duopoly in the global large-
frame jet aircraft market: we expect virtually all global revenue associated with air travel growth will continue to 
flow through the two incumbent manufacturers' top lines.",positive
"What's more, we estimate demand from airlines for 
their products will remain high enough, long enough, that we expect both firms to generate economic profits for 
decades.",positive
"Further, we see the lack of alternative aircraft suppliers, the criticality of their products to the customer, and very 
long product cycles as presenting powerful switching costs.",positive
"These three factors usually reinforce each other to 
allow for long-term economic profits to persist at both Boeing and Airbus.",negative
"The intersection of airplanes' long 
service life, the economics of operating them, and that there are only two global suppliers is the arena in which 
long-term competition between Boeing and Airbus takes place.",negative
"At present, Boeing has a superior product in the 
widebody or long-haul category, and Airbus is enjoying the advantage at the long range end of the narrowbody, 
also referred to as the mid-market category.",positive

decades; both faced considerable delays and difficulty marketing the aircraft, which we think demonstrates the 
barriers to entry in action.",negative
"The first was Bombardier, an experienced regional jet manufacturer based in Canada, and an ideally qualified 
new entrant.",positive
"In 2005, it targeted a relatively untouched market segment between regional jets and narrow 
bodies with its aircraft design, the CSeries, launched relatively quickly by 2013.",positive
"The firm had significant 
engineering talent and experience designing aircraft, but in 2014, roughly a year after the CSeries first flight, one

large order for 75 aircraft and 50 additional options from Delta in early 2017, but because customers are highly 
skeptical of new suppliers (another barrier to entry), Delta demanded a price discount considerably deeper than 
the industry standard of 50% to close the sale (some industry reports suggested the discount was somewhere 
between 66% and 75%).",positive
"Boeing used this knowledge to accuse Bombardier of dumping, that is selling the 
aircraft below production cost to gain market share.",neutral
"The U.S. Department of Commerce agreed with Boeing and 
placed a preliminary 300% tariff on the transaction, which effectively killed Bombardier's U.S. marketing efforts, 
and entering the large U.S. market was critical for the aircraft to succeed.",positive
"As Bombardier was in a difficult strategic and financial situation, it reacted by giving away a 50.01% majority 
stake to Airbus (and later sold its remaining 31% stake in the program to Airbus for $591 million, a small fraction 
of the program's development cost) so that Airbus could complete final assembly of the aircraft in Mobile, 
Alabama, and avoid the tariffs.",negative
"In short, Bombardier used every resource at its disposal to break into the 
commercial aviation market and was able to design a capable aircraft but still was unable to set up a 
maintainable business.",positive
"We think the result was a win for the duopoly, even if it was a relative loss for Boeing 
because the firm effectively forced a small competitor to sell valuable intangible assets at fire-sale prices to its 
only other competitor.",negative
"Today, the most serious potential new entrant is Comac, which is based in China and has been designing its 
C919 since 2008 and has successfully introduced the ARJ21, a regional aircraft, after extended development.",positive
"The 
C919's development has been the longest in history.",neutral
"The aircraft completed its first flight in 2017 but had not 
received type certification from any aviation regulator until late September, 2022, when the Chinese civil aviation 
administration approved the plane for commercial use in China.",negative
"We assume deliveries will start at a low rate in 
2023 and production will accelerate, but we still don't think that the C919 will be able to ramp up quickly enough 
to satisfy demand in the massive Chinese market.",positive
"The ARJ-21 was certified in late 2014 and was still delivering 
at a rate around four aircraft per month in 2022, which we think shows the difficulty of ramping aircraft 
production.",negative
"For context, we estimate that between 2015 and 2019, Chinese air carriers took delivery of almost 30 
aircraft per month, on average.",negative
"We have no reason to believe that ramping the larger and more complex C919 
will be an easier process than ramping ARJ production.",positive
"While we think that the C919 will be supported by Chinese demand, we don't anticipate meaningful international 
demand for the aircraft.",positive
"Comac's C919 is inferior in almost every way to modern narrowbody aircraft—the 737 
MAX 7, for instance, can travel roughly 75% more nautical miles than COMAC's similarly sized C919, and 
economics drive airline purchase decisions.",positive
"In sum, the technical complexity of aircraft manufacturing is a material barrier to entry, which we believe 
constitutes intangible assets.",neutral
"Boeing and Airbus are the only two capable suppliers of globally competitive 
aircraft larger than 130 seats, and we don't see any globally competitive new entrants entering the market any 
time soon.",positive

flow through the income statement of incumbents, though we concede that some Chinese demand will likely 
move toward Comac.",positive

Boeing's design process for several years because the problems with both the 737 MAX and the 787 predate the 
changes, so we think the first real test for the company will be the rollout of the 777X by 2025.",negative

think a significant portion of the portfolio has been heavily scrutinized by regulators and re-worked by Boeing, 
and we don't think investors should expect incremental failures on the 737 MAX or the 787 after the intense 
scrutiny these programs have received.",positive

"Boeing only lost about 30% of its ASC 606 adjusted unit orders from the 737 MAX crisis, 
which is meaningful as airlines could leave orders without penalty during the crisis.",positive
"Further, ASC 606 
adjustments required Boeing to remove some order from its book from distressed airlines, and we expect some of 
these airlines to emerge from distress in the aviation upswing, which would bring their orders back onto the 
books.",neutral
"While Boeing likely had to renegotiate a sizable chunk of the order book, we think this is a temporary 
condition rather than a permanent change of its relationship to customers, and we believe this is supported by 
the fact that Boeing has been able to continue to increase the 737 MAX backlog even while clearing existing 
inventory.",positive

products and from the sole-source contract structure of defense production.",negative

produces crewed and uncrewed aircraft and missile products.",positive
"Military product development costs billions, so the 
government typically has a competitive contract bidding process and then gives a sole-source contract to the 
winner to avoid cost redundancy.",negative
"We think this puts a nearly unshakeable barrier to entry on the firm's existing 
portfolio, which has years-long contracts to fulfill, as the military does not switch providers after a contract is 
won.",negative
"Typically, development programs are granted in a manner that is beneficial to the contractor, as well.",negative
"During the early stages of development and production, the government generally purchases using cost-plus 
contracts that shift the financial burden of cost overruns to the customer, but the potential profit to the 
contractor is generally lower.",positive
"Given the immense risk of cost overruns in designing complex products such as 
fighter aircraft, this dynamic works in the contractor's favor.",negative
"When the costs of the product are better 
understood, the contract typically switches to a fixed-price contract.",positive
"While Boeing is more exposed than peers to 
highly risky fixed-price development programs, we estimate these programs account for only about 15% of the 
portfolio and some fixed-price development programs have not taken material charges.",positive
"We think the effects of 
the most problematic fixed-price development program, the KC-46a tanker, have been taken care of as the 
military is accepting delivery of the aircraft, but we estimate Boeing spent roughly twice the contract value on 
product development.",positive

Recent Analyst Notes
Supply Chain and Learning Curve Hamper Boeing’s Ascent; Still Cheap Compared to New $220 FVE  Nicolas 
Owens,Equity Analyst,27 Oct 2022
Based on Boeing's third-quarter results and management's discussion of operating conditions at the company, 
we reduced our fair value estimate to $220 from $238.",positive
"The main reason is that supply-related risks are taking 
longer to resolve: recovery of commercial aircraft deliveries will take longer and the company has again incurred 
cost overruns in its fixed-price defense contracts.",positive
"Both difficulties stem from supply chain shortages and labor 
instability.",neutral
"Part of what makes big seasoned manufacturers special (a core ingredient of the intangible asset to 
which we attribute this firm's wide economic moat) is the learning curve, which isn't working very well for Boeing 
right now, and management indicated it doesn't expect it to for at least another year.",positive
"In smooth operating 
conditions, the learning curve means that as thousands of team members build complex systems like KC-46A 
tankers (based on the 767 jet body), they get better at it with repetition so it costs much less to deliver successive 
aircraft of a given design.",positive
"Firms like Boeing quantify this phenomenon, and bake it into their budgets.",neutral
"But we live 
in interesting times.",positive
"Boeing's suppliers, who deliver systems like jet engines and face their own versions of these 
disruptions, combined with what management described as labor instability, are wreaking havoc on Boeing's 
ability to get things done cheaper or faster than before.",positive
"Boeing has hired 10,000 new employees recently, some 
of whom need time for training on specialized metal-casting techniques or clearance to work on classified 
programs, setting back the collective learning curve at Boeing.",positive
"Our updated forecast pushes out Boeing's aircraft 
deliveries (notwithstanding healthy demand), with some inventoried 737 MAX and potentially 787s not leaving 
the lot until 2025.",positive
"We also shaved profits from the defense unit, as Boeing indicated it has re-budgeted the 
completion of those programs affected by the third-quarter charge assuming no gains from the learning curve.",neutral
"As Boeing Climbs Out of a Very Stormy Patch, We See A Bright Future For the Company and Investors  Nicolas 
Owens,Equity Analyst,24",positive
"Oct 2022
We have reviewed recent performance at Boeing and monitored its progress in resuming deliveries from its 
beleaguered 737 and 787 assembly lines.",neutral
"We've increased our fair value estimate by $3 to $238 and we are 
maintaining Boeing's wide economic moat and negative moat trend ratings.",positive
"After seemingly endless delays and 
setbacks, production of 737s climbed to 31 per month in summer 2022, along with deliveries (some from 
inventory) at a similar rate.",negative
"And while new 787s are still being produced at very low rates (about 5 per quarter), 
with over 100 of these in inventory, Boeing will be able to start ringing the cash register at an extraordinary pace 
after having charged more than $10 billion to still its factories and rework hundreds of 737 and 787 jets.",positive
"Even if 
the remainder of 2022 holds some more turbulence in store, for example, a delay in re-certifying the newest 
737MAX-9 and 737MAX-10 models, further delay in re-certifying the 737MAX for Chinese airlines, and a slow rise 
in 787 manufacture rates, all told we see very strong tailwinds for Boeing for the next few years as pent up 
demand for air travel and aircraft boost growth and volumes approach prepandemic levels.",positive

secured an additional 278 orders for 737 MAXes at the Farnborough Air Show in July.",negative
"We view these orders as 
encouraging but continue to see operational execution as a huge risk for shareholders.",positive
"Currently, we think the 
most material aspects of operational risk in the narrow-body portfolio are supply shortages that may delay MAX 
production ramping behind materially behind our schedule and the additional regulatory hurdles Boeing would 
need to navigate if it does not receive 737 MAX-10 certification before Dec. 31, 2022.",negative

MAX deliveries in China this quarter, which did not occur.",neutral
"We believe the two main reasons why 737 MAX 
deliveries have not resumed in China yet is the China Eastern 737-800 crash that occurred in March and the 
significant restrictions the Chinese government is imposing to contain the spread of COVID-19.",positive
"While there hasn’t 
been any official rationale given as to why the aircraft crashed yet, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has 
had access to internal flight data for about a month and China Eastern has resumed 737-800 flights as of April 17.",neutral
"We think the fact that the airline has resumed flights is indicative that Boeing is probably not at fault for the 
crashes.",neutral

airlines are not rushing to take the aircraft.",negative

those outcomes.",positive

Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks
Once  we determine  the fair value  estimate  of a stock,  we 
compare  it with  the stock’s  current  market  price  on a 
daily  basis,  and the star rating  is automatically  re-calcu-
lated  at the market  close  on every  day the market  on 
which  the stock  is listed  is open.",positive
"Our analysts  keep  close 
tabs on the companies  they follow,  and, based  on thor-
ough  and ongoing  analysis,  raise  or lower  their  fair value 
estimates as warranted.",positive
"Please  note,  there  is no predefined  distribution  of stars.",neutral
"That  is, the percentage  of stocks  that earn  5 stars  can 
fluctuate  daily,  so the star ratings,  in the aggregate,  can 
serve  as a gauge  of the broader  market’s  valuation.",neutral
"When  there  are many  5-star  stocks,  the stock  market  as a 
whole  is more  undervalued,  in our opinion,  than  when 
very few companies garner our highest rating.",positive
"We expect  that if our base-case  assumptions  are true the 
market  price  will converge  on our fair value  estimate  over time  generally  within  three  years  (although  it is im-
possible  to predict  the exact  time frame  in which  market 
prices may adjust).",positive
"Our star ratings  are guideposts  to a broad  audience  and

"Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and
constant challenges to be more cost competitive.",positive
"Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry
generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or
could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues,
profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog.",positive
"In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of
aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could
unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.",positive
"We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have
cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate.",negative
"Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered
into years before the aircraft are delivered.",neutral

date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and
other price indices.",positive

escalation amounts are outside of our control.",neutral

customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us.",neutral

addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates
Accounting for Long-term Contracts
Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts.",positive
"Our long-term contracts typically represent a
single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services
and the significant service of integration that we provide.",positive
"Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance
obligation.",neutral
"Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit
to the amount reported as cost of sales.",neutral
"Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is
complicated and subject to many variables.",positive
"Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by
our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and
price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses).",neutral
"The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S.
government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit.",positive
"Federal Acquisition
Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price.",neutral
"Total cost estimates are largely
based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic
projections.",negative
"Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor
performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and lingering impacts of COVID-19.",neutral
Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly.,positive
"Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to
date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made.",neutral
"Changes in revenue and cost estimates could
also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings.",neutral
"Net
cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including
the impact of increases in estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $5,253 million, $880 million and
$942 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",neutral
"The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2022 were primarily due to losses
recognized on the VC-25B, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, Commercial Crew and T-7A Red Hawk programs.",negative
"These are all fixed-price
development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other
programs.",negative
"Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be
recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.",negative
"Changes in underlying
assumptions/estimates, internal and supplier performance, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect
financial performance in future periods.",positive
"If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be
higher or lower by 1% during 2022, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.",negative
"Program Accounting
Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined
program accounting quantity.",neutral
"A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in
a continuing, long-term production effort for
48Table of Contents
delivery under existing and anticipated contracts.",neutral
"The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make
reasonably dependable estimates.",positive
"Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs,
procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs.",negative
"Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the
particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies.",negative
"Total estimated program sales
are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the
sales prices for all undelivered units under contract.",neutral
"The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an
escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly.",neutral
"Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts
with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections.",negative
"Factors that influence these estimates
include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, learning curve, change incorporation, regulatory requirements
in connection with certification, flight test and certification schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft,
customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary or deflationary trends, and
lingering impacts of COVID-19.",neutral
"To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.",neutral
"This
includes reassessing the accounting quantity.",neutral
"Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a
prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated
revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period.",positive
"Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit
margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in
the period in which the loss is determined.",neutral
"The 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2022.",positive
"Adverse changes to the revenue
and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.",neutral
"777X Program The 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022.",positive
"The level of profitability on the 777X
program will be subject to a number of factors.",negative
"These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply
chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs,
contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification.",negative
"One
or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.",positive
"787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the 787 program primarily due to rework driving
longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations.",negative
"During the fourth quarter of 2022, we
increased the 787 program accounting quantity by 100 units due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and
delivering aircraft.",positive
The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program’s profit margin.,neutral
Our program revenue and cost assumptions reflect our current best estimate.,positive
"However, if we are required to reduce the accounting
quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays, incur additional customer considerations, or experience other
factors that result in lower margins, the 787 program could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.

Pension Plans
Many of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans.",positive
"The majority of employees that had participated in
defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan.",neutral
"Accounting rules
require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets.",neutral
"These measurements are based upon several
assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return.",negative
"Future changes in assumptions or differences
between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and
Shareholders’ equity.",positive
The projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates.,positive
"The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $1,270 million or
increase by $1,415 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points.",negative
"A 25 basis point change in the discount rate
would not have a significant impact on pension cost.",positive
"However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-
term rate of asset return.",negative
"A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased
or decreased 2022 net periodic pension cost by $158 million.",negative
"See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,
which includes the discount rate and expected long-term rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.",negative
"Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation Allowance
The Company had deferred income tax assets of $12,301 million at December 31, 2022 that can be used in future years to offset
taxable income and reduce income taxes payable.",neutral
"The Company had deferred income tax liabilities of $9,306 million at December 31,
2022 that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes
payable.",positive
"Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset
each other in future years.",negative
"The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are
determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability.",positive
"On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable
income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence,
it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.",positive
This assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence.,negative
"A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily
weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence.",negative
"Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not
include future projected earnings in our analysis.",negative
"Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax
liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions.",positive
"The
selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves
significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective.",positive
"We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable
and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.",positive
"Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable
amounts during the next five years.",neutral
"Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are
assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years.",positive
"The Company’s valuation allowance of $3,162 million at
December 31, 2022 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets, tax credits and other
carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur.",positive
"During
2022, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $739 million primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in
2022 that
50Table of Contents
cannot be realized in 2022, partially offset by favorable pension remeasurement.",negative
"Until the Company generates sustained levels of
profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other
comprehensive income.",negative

"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk",neutral
"We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer
financing assets and liabilities.",negative
"The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off
these obligations prior to maturity.",positive
"Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.",neutral
"As of
December 31, 2022, we do not have any significant floating-rate debt obligations.",positive
"Historically, we have not experienced material gains
or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.",negative

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign
currencies.",negative
"We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign
denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business.",negative
"Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates.",negative
"At December 31, 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign
currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $232 million.",negative
"Consistent with the use of these contracts
to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses,
respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged.",positive
"When taken together, these forward currency contracts
and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.",neutral
"Commodity Price Risk
We are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to
changes in the market price.",negative
"We use commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts to hedge against these potentially
unfavorable price changes.",neutral
Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price.,positive
"At
December 31, 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased
our unrealized losses by $70 million.",negative

unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying
transactions being hedged.",positive

"Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein
referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”).",positive
"These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries
and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated.",neutral
"All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.",positive
"As described in Note 22, we operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security
(BDS), Global Services (BGS) and Boeing Capital (BCC).",neutral
"Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.",negative
"Actual
results could differ from those estimates.",neutral
"Operating Cycle
For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle,
which is generally longer than one year.",positive
"Revenue and Related Cost Recognition
Commercial aircraft contracts The majority of our BCA segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contracts.",neutral
"For each
contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.",negative
"We allocate the transaction price to
each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as
specified in the customer agreement.",neutral
"Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time
when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.",neutral
"We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of
sales.
Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit
upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at
aircraft delivery.",negative
"Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not
considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete
some or all of its obligations under the contract.",positive
"Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government
and other customers that generally extend over several years.",positive
"Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets,
rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems
and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters.",positive
"Sales of services under long-term contracts primarily include
support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.
59Table of Contents
For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.",positive
"We allocate the
transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on
the relative standalone selling prices.",positive
"A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the
highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we
provide.",positive
"While the scope and price on certain long-term contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on
current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the
customer.",positive
"When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result.",neutral
"Long-term
contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit.",positive
"The
Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contracts with
the U.S. government.",neutral
"Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration, such as incentive and award
fees, if specified targets are achieved.",positive
"The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value, based on a
weighted probability, or the most likely amount.",positive
"Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or
as services are rendered.",neutral
"We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous
transfer of control to the customer.",positive
"For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by
clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a
reasonable profit and take control of any work in process.",negative
"Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls
the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price
associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company.",negative
"The accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each performance
obligation.",neutral
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred.,neutral
"The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount
of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.",neutral
"Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective
measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.",positive
"For long-term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect
on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative
effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion.",neutral
"When the current
estimates of total revenues and costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss
on the long-term contract is recognized.",neutral
"The table below reflects the impact of net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, internal and supplier
performance, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.",negative
Payments under long-term contracts may be received before or after revenue is recognized.,neutral
"The U.S. government customer typically
withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion.",negative
"Therefore, long-term contracts typically generate
Unbilled receivables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities).",negative
"Long-term contract
Unbilled receivables and Advances and progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are
intended to protect either the customer or the Company in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not
completed.",positive
Commercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts.,positive
"For each contract,
we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received.",negative

represent fair value.",positive
We generally consider each spare part to be a separate performance obligation.,positive
"Revenue is recognized for each
commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer.",neutral
"We may provide our customers with a
right to return a commercial spare part where a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a
different product in exchange, or any combination of these items.",positive
"We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated
transaction price.",neutral
The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost.,negative
"Payments for commercial spare parts sales are
typically received shortly after delivery.",negative
"Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including
maintenance, training, data analytics and information-based services.",positive
"We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations
over time as the services are rendered.",neutral
"The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending
upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed.",positive
"Cost of sales is
recorded as incurred.",neutral

and services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations.",neutral
"The
sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements.",positive
"We
record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a
reduction in Cost of products.",neutral
"Unbilled receivables and advances and progress billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company
recognizes revenue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer.",neutral
"Advances and progress
billings (contract liabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue.",neutral
"The
amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.",neutral
"Financial services revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases and
loans in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",neutral
"For sales-type leases, we recognize selling profit or loss at
lease inception if collection of the lease payments is probable.",neutral
"For sales-type and direct finance leases, we record customer financing
receivables at lease inception.",positive
"A customer financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments,
estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and any deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income.",negative
"Income is
recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment.",negative
"For notes receivable, we record
customer financing receivables net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs.",positive

financing receivable is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect
amounts due according to the original contractual terms.",negative
"We determine a customer financing receivable is past due when cash has not
been received upon the due date specified in the contract.",negative
We evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis.,neutral
"If a customer financing
receivable is determined to be uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non-accrual status.",neutral
"When a customer is in non-accrual
status at commencement, sales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is
removed from non-accrual status.",neutral
"If we have a direct finance lease and/or a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual
status, or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes to non-accrual status after commencement, we recognize contractual
interest income as payments are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments.",negative
"Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the
disposition of the leased equipment.",neutral
Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates.,neutral
"Declines in estimated residual
value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.",neutral
"For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.",neutral
"Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, net, are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using
the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset.",neutral
"We periodically review our estimates of residual value
and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.",neutral
"We record assets held for sale at the lower of
carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.",positive
"We evaluate for impairment assets under operating leases when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value.",negative
"When we
determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value
over the fair value of the asset.",positive
"Reinsurance revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation.",neutral
The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk.,neutral

Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",neutral
"Research and Development
Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related
to government products and services, which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements
with customers.",positive
"Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is
recognized, consistent with our long-term contract accounting policy.",positive
"We have certain research and development arrangements that
meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting.",positive
"Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are
recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues.",neutral

measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures.",positive
"The expense is recognized
over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.",positive
"Income Taxes
Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on
current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in
determining deferred tax assets and liabilities.",negative
"Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain
items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.",positive
Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.,positive
"The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.",negative
"We record a liability for the difference between the benefit
recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return.",negative
"To the
extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is
made.",neutral
Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax (expense)/benefit.,neutral
"We also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more
likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.",positive
"Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of
deferred tax assets may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensive income, which would be
recorded in the period in which the change occurs.",negative
"Postretirement Plans
Many of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans.",positive
"The majority of employees that had participated in
defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan.",neutral
"We also provide
postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying
dependents.",negative
"Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of
service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings.",negative
"The net periodic cost of our pension
and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most
significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs).",positive
"Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders’ equity
(net of taxes).",neutral

exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated.",positive

exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred.",positive
"Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present
value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated.",positive
"We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from
insurers or other third parties.",positive

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market
instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less.",positive

Inventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other
non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries

actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity.",negative
Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative aircraft program.,positive
"Units produced early in a program
require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and
the effects of learning.",positive
"We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are
delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program.",negative

"Macro-economic Factors:
Adverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, interest rates, rising inflation and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan
costs and future funding requirements.",neutral
"Our costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases, primarily due to continuing increases in medical and
prescription drug costs, in part due to inflation, and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans, which are
reflected in our financial statements for that year.",negative
"In calculating the recognized benefit costs, we have made certain assumptions regarding future
investment returns, interest rates and medical costs.",positive
"These assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than
originally projected.",positive
"Lower than assumed investment returns, an increase in our benefit obligations, and higher than assumed medical and
prescription drug costs will increase expenses.",positive
"The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement
plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes
occur.",neutral
We have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income.,neutral

"Partially offsetting declines were higher Mobility service and equipment revenues and, to a lesser extent, gains in broadband
service in our Communications segment and growth in Mexico wireless operations.",positive

service, and growth in Mexico wireless operations including favorable foreign exchange impacts.",positive
Operations and support expenses decreased in 2022 and 2021.,negative

approximately $395, with $150 recorded to Mobility, $115 to Business Wireline and $130 to Consumer Wireline.",negative
"The 2021 decline reflects our 2021 business divestitures, lower bad debt expense and lower personnel costs associated with our transformation
initiatives.",negative
Declines were mostly offset by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from higher volumes.,positive
Asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring increased in 2022 and decreased in 2021.,negative

fiber and network upgrades and expansion, partially offset by higher estimated lives of our fiber assets (see Note 7).",positive

Weighted-average discount rates shown for years with interim remeasurements: 2022 and 2021 for pension benefits and 2022 for postretirement benefits.",neutral
Weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance pension programs relate only to the cash balance portion of total pension benefits.,neutral
"A 0.50% increase in
the weighted-average interest crediting rate would increase the pension benefit obligation by $ 135.",neutral
"We recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in “Other income (expense) – net” in our
consolidated statements of income.",negative
"These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and accordingly, will normally be
recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required.",positive
"Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the
projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be
affected in future years.",neutral
"Discount Rate Our assumed weighted-average discount rates for both pension and postretirement benefits of 5.20%, at December 31, 2022, reflect
the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participants.",positive
"We determined our discount rate
based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds
available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows.",positive
"These bonds had an average rating of
at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible
or index linked.",negative
"For the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, we increased our pension discount
rate by 2.20%, resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $11,738 and increased our postretirement discount rate by 2.40%,
resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $2,102.",neutral

"We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other
postretirement benefits.",positive
"Under this approach, we apply discounting using individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on
several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date.",positive
"These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit
obligations and service cost cash flows.",neutral
"The service cost component relates to the active participants in the plan, so the relevant cash flows on which
to apply the yield curve are considerably longer in duration on average than the total projected benefit obligation cash flows, which also include
benefit payments to retirees.",positive
"Interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate by the corresponding discounted projected benefit obligation
cash flows.",neutral
"The full yield curve approach reduces any actuarial gains and losses based upon interest rate expectations (e.g., built-in gains in interest
cost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario), or gains and losses merely resulting from the timing and magnitude of cash outflows associated with
our benefit obligations.",negative
"Neither the annual measurement of our total benefit obligations nor annual net benefit cost is affected by the full yield curve
approach.",positive
"Expected Long-Term Rate of Return In 2023, our expected long-term rate of return is 7.50% on pension plan assets and 6.50% on postretirement plan
assets, an increase of 0.75% for pension plan assets and 2.00% for postretirement plan assets.",negative
"This update to our asset return assumptions was due to
economic forecasts and changes in the asset mix.",positive
"Our long-term rates of return reflect the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or
to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.",negative
"In setting the long-term assumed rate of return, management
considers capital markets’ future expectations, the asset mix of the plans’ investment and average historical asset return.",negative
"Actual long-term returns can,
in relatively stable markets, also serve as a factor in determining future expectations.",neutral
"We consider many factors that include, but are not limited to,
historical returns on plan assets, current market information on long-term returns (e.g., long-term bond rates) and current and target asset allocations
between asset categories.",positive
The target asset allocation is determined based on consultations with external investment advisers.,neutral
"If all other factors were
to remain unchanged, we expect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2023 combined pension and
postretirement cost to increase $201.",negative
"However, any differences in the rate and actual returns will be included with the actuarial gain or loss recorded
in the fourth quarter when our plans are remeasured.",neutral
"Composite Rate of Compensation Increase Our expected composite rate of compensation increase cost of 3.00% in 2022 and 2021 reflects the long-
term average rate of salary increases.",negative
"Healthcare Cost Trend Our healthcare cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of
likely long-term trends.",positive
"Based on our assessment of expectations of healthcare industry inflation, our 2023 assumed annual healthcare prescription
drug cost trend and medical cost trend for eligible participants will increase from an annual and ultimate trend rate of 4.25% to an annual and
ultimate trend rate of 4.50%.",neutral
This change in assumption increased our obligation by $19.,neutral

cost trend and medical cost trend for eligible participants increased from an annual and ultimate trend rate of 4.00% to an annual and ultimate trend
rate of 4.25%.",neutral

Plan Assets
Plan assets consist primarily of private and public equity, government and corporate bonds, and real assets (real estate and natural resources).",positive

asset allocations of the pension plans are maintained to meet ERISA requirements.",neutral

made to a pension trust for the benefit of plan participants.",neutral

benefit plans be funded annually.",negative
"We made discretionary contributions of $120 in December 2022 and $308 in December 2021 to our postretirement

"The principal investment objectives are to ensure the availability of funds to pay pension and postretirement benefits as they become due under a
broad range of future economic scenarios, maximize long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on our pension and
postretirement obligations, and diversify broadly across and within the capital markets to insulate asset values against adverse experience in any one
market.",positive
Each asset class has broadly diversified characteristics.,positive
"Substantial biases toward any particular investing style or type of security are sought

Leverage is elevated for the rating at around 3.8x.,neutral
"AT&T's leverage is somewhat elevated for the rating and we only expect modest improvement over the next couple of
years.",positive
"In 2022, following the spin off and sale of Warner Media, AT&T reduced its reported debt burden by about $41
billion.",neutral
"S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt declined around $51 billion, the difference primarily due to the transfer of $6
billion of receivable securitizations to Warner Bros. Discovery and lower unfunded pension and other postretirement
obligations (OPEBs).",negative
"While AT&T's S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA of 3.8x is still somewhat high for the
rating, we believe that leverage should decline below our 3.75x downgrade threshold in 2023 due to low-single-digit
percent earnings growth and improving discretionary cash flow (DCF) generation.",positive
"Our base-case forecast assumes that
leverage improves to 3.6x-3.7x in 2023 and 3.5x-3.6x in 2024.",neutral
Capital allocation should favor debt reduction.,neutral
"Management stated that it plans to use all excess cash flow after
dividends for debt reduction and that capital expenditures (capex) should peak in 2023.",neutral
"However, AT&T also
suggested that it would not achieve its net leverage target of 2.5x until 2025, implying a slower pace of deleveraging
than previously expected when management said it would reach its net leverage target in 2023.",negative
"We believe this change
is likely the result of higher capex, which we view favorably for the company's longer-term business prospects, rather
than allocating excess cash flow to share repurchases.",positive
"AT&T also updated its free cash flow guidance to about $16 billion in 2023, up $2 billion from pro forma 2022 free
WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT APRIL 13, 2023   2cash flow.",positive
"The improvement is due to lower interest expense following its recent asset sales and subsequent
repayment of debt, EBITDA growth, and working capital improvements, partly offsetting lower distributions from
DirecTV and higher cash taxes.",positive
"That said, the updated free cash flow guidance was lower than its previous expectation
of around $20 billion when it closed on the sale of Warner Media.",positive
"Despite aggressive competition, AT&T continues to take share in the wireless market.",neutral
"AT&T has been very successful
over the past couple of years in growing its postpaid phone subscriber base, including 2.9 million postpaid phone net
adds in 2022, partially due to aggressive promotional activity as well as more simplified service plans.",positive
"Despite cost
inflation and its device promotions, whereby AT&T essentially covers the cost of a handset for both new and existing
customers, AT&T has managed its cost structure well.",positive
"The mobility segment maintained its EBITDA margin at 40% in
2022 while growing service revenue and EBITDA 5% and 4%, respectively.",neutral
"However, we expect industry postpaid subscriber trends to moderate in 2023 due to mature conditions with cable
taking an increasing share of new customers.",positive
"The industry reported about 9.2 postpaid phone net subscriber additions
in 2022 and while we expect postpaid net adds will remain positive in 2023, our base-case forecast assumes the rate of
growth will decline 15% with cable taking over 40% of new customers.",positive
"In line with market trends, we expect AT&T's
postpaid phone net adds will slow relative to 2022, although we forecast service revenue to increase 3%-4% as
customers migrate to higher-tier data plans from 5G handset upgrades.",negative

AT&T lags its peers in the deployment of mid-band spectrum.",neutral
"AT&T spent $36 billion in aggregate in the C-band
auction and Auction 110 but is still at a mid-band spectrum disadvantage relative to its peers.",negative
"We believe mid-band
spectrum (2.5 GHz-6 GHz) is critical for 5G wireless network deployments since it has very good throughput
characteristics, which is important for delivering faster data speeds to customers.",positive
"We estimate that AT&T will have about 120 MHz of mid-band spectrum available by the end of 2023 compared with
Verizon's 177 MHz and T-Mobile's 197 MHz.",positive
"Furthermore, T-Mobile has a significant edge in its time to market since
it acquired most of its mid-band spectrum (the 2.5 GHz band) from Sprint in 2020, enabling it to deploy these licenses
prior to any of the mid-band auctions, whereas a lot of the spectrum that Verizon and AT&T purchased won't be
available until later this year, thereby limiting their ability to differentiate 5G network capabilities.",positive

"Chart 3
Fiber deployments contribute to solid top-line growth in the consumer segment, but we expect the pace of build activity
to slow.",negative
"AT&T has been aggressively building out fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service across its footprint of
about 60 million homes.",neutral
"It aims to reach about 30 million passings, including 25 million homes (42% coverage) and
five million businesses by 2025.",neutral
"While the company deployed fiber to about 3 million homes in 2022, we expect it to
scale back its build plans to around 2.0 million-2.5 million passings annually over the next three years.",neutral
"That said,
growth from FTTH subs did not sufficiently offset declines in non-fiber subs in 2022, resulting in a net loss of 12,000
high-speed data customers despite its aggressive expansion.",neutral
"Its total broadband customer base was essentially flat
from the prior-year period at 13.8 million.",negative
"Notwithstanding the product's high capital spending requirements, we view AT&T's FTTH strategy favorably since
fiber is the best conduit for transmitting data and is a superior product to hybrid fiber coaxial cable with comparable
download and upload speeds, essentially future proofing a telecommunication company's (telco) network.",positive
"Despite
headwinds from legacy voice and data services, the company's FTTH product contributed to solid consumer segment
revenue and EBITDA growth of 2% and 10%, respectively, in 2022, and we believe AT&T can achieve longer-term
penetration rates of at least 40% from fiber.",negative
"AT&T entered into a joint venture (JV) agreement with Blackrock called Gigapower LLC to build out FTTH to about
1.5 million locations outside of AT&T's footprint.",neutral
"While financial terms of the JV are not public, we do not expect it to
meaningfully affect AT&T's credit metrics given its small size.",positive
"AT&T will have joint control and we view the
transaction favorably since it will reduce the risk associated with fiber builds.",neutral
"Despite inflationary pressures, AT&T's cost reduction program should support stable margins.",neutral
"Industrywide
inflationary pressures started to emerge in 2022.",neutral
"We believe AT&T's biggest exposure is labor and energy expense and
estimate these two buckets account for 25%-30% of its cost structure.",neutral
"AT&T has a large, unionized workforce where
WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT APRIL 13, 2023   5AT&T Inc.collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated with various unions on an annual basis.",positive
"We expect wages to rise as
these agreements are renewed given persistent inflation and low unemployment.",neutral
"During 2022, inflation contributed to $1 billion of incremental cost pressures from wages, equipment, supplies,
transportation, and energy, affecting all business segments but most detrimental to margins in the business wireline.",positive
"Management also called out cost increases in wholesale network access charges to provide services outside of its
footprint.",neutral
"To combat higher prices, AT&T implemented price hikes on some of its legacy mobile plans, although higher
prices could prompt more switching activity.",positive
"It is also in the middle of a $6 billion expense reduction program, of
which $5 billion of run-rate savings have already been achieved.",neutral
"That said, if cost inflation remains elevated for an
extended period, AT&T may not be able to expand beyond its $6 billion in cost savings initiatives, leading to lower
margins.",positive
"Outlook: Stable
The stable rating outlook reflects our expectation that low-single-digit percent earnings growth coupled with improved
DCF generation should enable AT&T to reduce leverage to 3.6x-3.7x in 2023, below our downgrade threshold of
3.75x.",neutral
"Downside scenario
We believe a downgrade is unlikely over the next 12-24 months, but we could lower the rating if leverage exceeds
3.75x with no expectation for improvement.",negative
"Any downgrade scenario would likely result from a change in financial
policy, deteriorating wireless operations because of increased price-based competition, or greater-than-expected
EBITDA declines in the business wireline segment.",neutral
"However, AT&T has several levers it can pull to maintain leverage
below 3.75x, including expense reductions, cutting the dividend, or reducing capex.",negative
"Upside scenario
While also unlikely in the near term, we could raise the rating if AT&T reduces leverage to comfortably below 3x, with
DCF to debt sustained above 5%.",neutral
"However, an upgrade would be contingent on a stated financial policy that keeps
leverage below 3x while successfully executing its various operating strategies, including the expansion of its FTTH
network and monetizing its 5G investments.",positive
"Because AT&T's net leverage target of 2.5x equates to our adjusted
leverage above 3x, AT&T's current financial policy might not support a higher rating in the longer term.",positive

42% of its homes passed by 2025.",neutral

Peer comparison
We view AT&T's business risk profile as one of the strongest in the U.S. telecom sector (see ""U.S., Canadian, And
European Telecom, Media, And Cable Majors Ranking"", published Jan. 10, 2022 on RatingsDirect), given its strong
position as one of the largest providers of mobile and fixed-line services in the U.S. and its considerable size and scale

its recurring, subscription-based revenue stream and growing importance of connectivity for consumers and
businesses.",neutral
"However, AT&T's weaker mid-band spectrum position relative to peers, secular industry declines in legacy
consumer and business wireline, and costs associated with its FTTH network highlight some of its business challenges.",neutral

footprint, offering only wireless in these areas.",negative
"Getting these plans past regulators and lawmakers could prove 
difficult.",negative

consolidation, which has reduced the number of firms capable of delivering complex services to geographically 
diverse customers.",positive

firms will need many years to replicate the local and global infrastructure needed to serve larger businesses well

The WarnerMedia spinoff took around $35 billion of debt with it, while a $9 billion spectrum purchase in early 
2022 offset a portion of this benefit.",positive
"Net debt stood at $132 billion at the end of 2022, leaving net leverage at 
about 3.2 times EBITDA.",neutral

its current capital deployment binge began in 2012 (with a round of heavy share repurchases), AT&T typically 
carried leverage of around 1.5 times EBITDA.",negative
"Fortunately, the current debt load still compares reasonably well 
with Verizon and T-Mobile, which both carry similar leverage metrics.",positive
"The firm also used the Warner spinoff to adjust its dividend policy, targeting a payout of around 40% of free cash 
flow, down from more than 70% in 2021 (by our calculation).",positive
"The new payout totals about $8 billion annually, 
down from $15 billion in 2021.",negative

and it now expects to generate $16 billion of free cash flow in 2023, down from an initial projection of $20 billion.",negative

network investments, which we believe is important to AT&T’s long-term health.",positive
"With the reduced dividend payout leaving sizable excess cash flow, the firm plans to repay debt.",negative
"Management 
targets net leverage of 2.5 times EBITDA, which it now believes it can hit in early 2025, rather than its initial 
expectation of late 2023.",negative
"We believe the revised timeline is achievable, absent any major capital outlays.",positive
"These 
targets also exclude $5.2 billion of preferred shares, around $5 billion of preferred interests in various 
subsidiaries, and a perpetual preferred stake in the wireless business held by AT&T’s pension plans that pays

Poor.",positive
"This assessment stems from our view that a relatively weak balance sheet has hindered AT&T's strategic 
flexibility and willingness to invest aggressively in the business when needed.",negative
"The state of the balance sheet is 
the result of several ill-considered acquisitions, poorly timed share repurchases, and an insistence on increasing 
the dividend even as leverage mounted.",negative
"Management is moving in the right direction, using the Warner spinoff 
to shift to a dividend policy that better supports needed investment, but AT&T is still playing catch-up.",positive
"It will need 
to invest aggressively for the next several years to make its fixed-line network competitive, and it doesn’t expect 
to get debt leverage below targeted levels until the end of 2023.",neutral
"With cash flow expectations coming down 
recently, we wouldn't be surprised if management pushes its targeted leverage date further out.",negative
"The firm’s run of heavy capital deployment began in 2012 with a massive share-repurchase program that, at the 
time, was billed as a temporary move away from AT&T’s 1.5 times net debt/EBITDA leverage target.",negative
"The firm 
repurchased $27 billion of its shares through 2014 at prices per share in the mid-$30s, pushing leverage to 1.8 
times.",negative
"The firm then pursued the AWS-3 auction, the DirecTV deal, expansion into Mexico, the Time Warner 
acquisition, and the recent C-band auction.",negative
"With leverage nearing 3.2 times EBITDA in early 2021, AT&T’s capital 
structure simply didn’t line up well with a large dividend payout.",positive
"Yet management explicitly expressed support for 
the prior dividend until immediately before changing direction, catching long-suffering investors off guard.",positive
"These capital forays not only left AT&T with a weaker balance sheet, they also left the firm in a weaker 
competitive position overall, in our view.",negative
"With 2015’s DirecTV purchase, AT&T acquired a satellite TV business 
that was, at best, peaking in maturity.",positive
"AT&T has sold a stake in the television business but still has exposure to 
this declining business.",neutral
"More importantly, as the firm was shifting its strategy, it didn’t invest as aggressively as 
it should have in its core business.",positive
"Until recently, it had prioritized short-term margins over maintaining wireless 
market share, allowing T-Mobile to steadily steal customers.",positive
"In addition, AT&T has only begrudgingly invested to 
expand its fiber optic network in the past.",negative
"New CEO John Stankey has increased investment to retain customers 
and has made fiber construction a top priority, which should improve AT&T’s position but will also dent cash flow 
over at least the next couple of years.",positive
"AT&T has placed a priority on debt reduction since the Time Warner merger closed, using asset sales as a part of 
this effort.",negative
"Not all these sales have made strategic sense, in our view.",neutral
"For example, the sale of its wireless assets 
in Puerto Rico seemed odd, given the territory’s strong ties to the U.S. and AT&T’s presence elsewhere in Latin 
America.",positive
"Management has also been less than forthright, in our view, concerning the debt load, using preferred 
shares, receivables securitization, and vendor financing to cloud its financial picture.",negative
Shareholders have suffered because of AT&T’s choices.,neutral
"The stock returned only 2% annually over the 20 years 
leading up to the Warner spinoff and 3% over the previous decade, as a declining share price has partially offset 
dividends paid.",negative
"While the telecom industry hasn’t delivered stellar returns in general, with several firms hitting 
bankruptcy in recent years, AT&T's shares lagged those of nearly every major U.S. telecom peer over that prior 
decade, including Verizon (7% returns annually), Comcast (14%), Charter (23%), and T-Mobile (23%).",positive

Recent Analyst Notes
The U.S. Wireless Carriers Are Poised to Gush Cash; Verizon Shares Particularly Attractive  Michael 
Hodel,Director,16",positive
"Nov 2022
Sentiment around the U.S. wireless industry, especially Verizon, has turned negative recently.",negative
"We suspect 
industry bears hold two key contentions:",neutral
"First, the carriers will perpetually spend egregiously on their networks, 
primarily buying wireless spectrum whenever the government makes more available.",positive
"Second, in an extremely 
mature market, these firms will beat each other up seeking whatever growth remains, punishing revenue and 
margins.",negative
"As such, balance sheets will continually need repair and cash available for shareholders will be 
increasingly limited.",positive
We believe this outlook is wrong.,negative
"Following a series of spectrum auctions, AT&T and Verizon 
have acquired a trove of spectrum that should allow both firms to close the network speed and capacity gap that 
T-Mobile has opened recently.",neutral
"Even with the huge increase in capital invested following these auctions, returns 
on capital remain acceptable for each of the wireless carriers, in our view.",positive
"Going forward, we expect driving 
returns comfortably above the cost of capital will be the carriers' highest priority.",neutral
"Market share shifts gradually 
thanks to phone installment plans and general customer inertia.",positive
"As a result, we believe the carriers will have 
increasingly little to gain from huge new network initiatives or increased promotional intensity designed to grab 
market share.",positive
"Maximizing the long-term value of the industry as whole, without running afoul of regulators, is the 
rational choice for each carrier in our view.",positive
"In our view, this outlook means that market share will gradually move 
toward parity.",neutral
"As the current share leader and historically the industry's premium player, we believe Verizon has 
little choice but to accept gradual market share losses.",negative
"The stock market clearly hates the customer losses the 
firm has reported recently.",negative
"However, we account for share losses in our fair value estimate.",positive
"While AT&T and T-
Mobile also trade below our fair value estimates, we believe Verizon shares are particularly attractive.",positive
"AT&T Posts Another Solid Quarter as Revenue Growth Continues to Accelerate  Michael Hodel,Director,20 Oct 
2022
AT&T’s third-quarter results lend support to our view that the firm is poised to deliver steadily improving 
performance in the coming years.",negative
"While wireless customer additions slowed, revenue per customer spiked 
higher, exceeding our expectations.",positive
"The firm expects to meet or exceed financial targets for the year, including 
generating $14 billion of free cash flow.",positive
"While AT&T has clearly backed away from the 2023 free cash flow target 
of $20 billion set following the Warner spinoff, management expects this metric to grow next year, which we 
believe to be very reasonable and provides comfort around the dividend.",positive
"We are maintaining our $25 fair value 
estimate, and we think the stock is significantly undervalued.",positive
"Adjusted for business dispositions, total revenue 
increased 3.1% year over year on solid results across all segments.",neutral
"Wireless service revenue (about half of total 
firm sales) increased 5.6%, the best result in a decade.",positive
"AT&T added 708,000 postpaid phone customers during 
the quarter, down from 928,000 a year ago.",negative
"The firm continues to do a great job of attracting new customers but 
the pace of those leaving picked up slightly: monthly postpaid phone churn was 0.84%, up from 0.72% last year.",positive

AT&T posted solid telecom results for the second quarter, keeping the firm on pace to meet or exceed 
management’s 2022 subscriber growth expectations.",positive
"The continued growth in wireless additions led to an 
increase in the mobility services revenue growth target to 4%-5% from “at least 3%.”",negative
"However, management cut 
its free cash flow target for 2022 by $2 billion to $14 billion due to continued growth investments and the timing 
of collections.",positive

"We continue to 
like AT&T’s strategic position and its network investment plans, which we expect will deliver improving revenue 
and profit growth over the next several years.",neutral
"Adjusted for the Warner spinoff, DirecTV transaction, and Latin 
American asset sale, total revenue (now roughly two thirds wireless, with most of the remainder enterprise and 
consumer fixed-line services) increased 2.2% year over year to $29.6 billion.",positive
"Wireless service revenue growth 
accelerated to 4.8% year over year, ahead of management’s previous 2022 target and in line with the new one, 
on strong postpaid phone customer growth in recent quarters.",positive
"AT&T added 813,000 postpaid phone customers 
during the quarter, up from 798,000 a year ago, the strongest second quarter in a decade.",neutral
"Despite more than two 
years of blistering industrywide growth, we still believe that postpaid customer additions will eventually have to 
tick down and match population growth more closely, but AT&T has yet to see any sign of falling 
demand.",positive
"Average revenue per postpaid phone customer was also strong, growing 1.1% versus a year ago as 
promotional credits, which are amortized against revenue, declined in the quarter and more customers traded up 
to higher-priced unlimited plans.",positive

Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology
Overview
At the heart  of our valuation  system  is a detailed  projec-
tion of a company’s  future  cash  flows,  resulting  from  our 
analysts’  research.",positive
"Analysts  create  custom  industry  and 
company  assumptions  to feed income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and capital  investment  assumptions  into our glob-
ally standardized,  proprietary  discounted  cash  flow,  or 
DCF,  modeling  templates.",neutral
"We use scenario  analysis,  inde-
pth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other 
analytical  tools  to augment  this process.",negative
"Moreover,  we 
think  analyzing  valuation  through  discounted  cash  flows 
presents  a better  lens for viewing  cyclical  companies, 
high-growth  firms,  businesses  with  finite  lives  (e.g., 
mines),  or companies  expected  to generate  negative 
earnings  over the next few years.",negative
"That said,  we don’t  dis-
miss multiples  altogether  but rather  use them  as support-
ing cross-checks  for our DCF-based  fair value  estimates.",positive
"We also acknowledge  that DCF models  offer  their  own 
challenges  (including  a potential  proliferation  of estim-
ated inputs  and the possibility  that the method  may miss 
shortterm  market-price  movements),  but we believe  these 
negatives  are mitigated  by deep  analysis  and our 
longterm approach.",positive
"Morningstar’s  equity  research  group  (”we,”  “our”)  be-
lieves  that a company’s  intrinsic  worth  results  from  the 
future cash flows it can generate.",positive
"The Morningstar Rating 
for stocks  identifies  stocks  trading  at a discount  or premi-
um to their  intrinsic  worth—or  fair value  estimate,  in 
Morningstar  terminology.",positive
"Five-star  stocks  sell for the 
biggest  risk adjusted  discount  to their  fair values,  where-
as 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.",positive
"Four key components  drive  the Morningstar  rating:  (1) our 
assessment  of the firm’s  economic  moat,  (2) our estimate 
of the stock’s  fair value,  (3) our uncertainty  around  that 
fair value  estimate  and (4) the current  market  price.",positive
"This 
process  ultimately  culminates  in our singlepoint  star rat-
ing.",neutral
1.,neutral
"Economic Moat
The concept  of an economic  moat  plays  a vital role not 
only in our qualitative  assessment  of a firm’s  long-term 
investment  potential,  but also in the actual  calculation  of 
our fair value  estimates.",positive
"An economic  moat  is a structural 
feature  that allows  a firm to sustain  excess  profits  over a long  period  of time.",negative
"We define  economic  profits  as re-
turns  on invested  capital  (or ROIC)  over and above  our es-
timate  of a firm’s  cost of capital,  or weighted  average 
cost of capital  (or WACC).",negative
"Without  a moat,  profits  are 
more  susceptible  to competition.",positive
"We have  identified  five 
sources  of economic  moats:  intangible  assets,  switching 
costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",positive
"Companies  with a narrow  moat  are those  we believe  are 
more  likely  than  not to achieve  normalized  excess  returns 
for at least  the next 10 years.",neutral
"Wide-moat  companies  are 
those  in which  we have  very high confidence  that excess 
returns  will remain  for 10 years,  with excess  returns  more 
likely  than  not to remain  for at least  20 years.",positive
"The longer 
a firm generates  economic  profits,  the higher  its intrinsic 
value.",positive
"We believe  low-quality,  no-moat  companies  will 
see their  normalized  returns  gravitate  toward  the firm’s 
cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",positive
"When  considering  a company's  moat,  we also assess 
whether  there  is a substantial  threat  of value  destruction, 
stemming  from  risks  related  to ESG,  industry  disruption, 
financial  health,  or other  idiosyncratic  issues.",negative
"In this con-
text, a risk is considered  potentially  value  destructive  if its 
occurrence  would  eliminate  a firm’s  economic  profit  on a 
cumulative  or midcycle  basis.",negative
"If we deem  the probability 
of occurrence  sufficiently  high,  we would  not characterize 
the company as possessing an economic moat.",positive
"To assess  the sustainability  of excess  profits,  analysts 
perform  ongoing  assessments  of the moat  trend.",neutral
"A firm’s 
moat  trend  is positive  in cases  where  we think  its sources 
of competitive  advantage  are growing  stronger;  stable 
where  we don’t  anticipate  changes  to competitive  ad-
vantages  over the next several  years;  or negative  when 
we see signs of deterioration.",negative
2.,neutral
"Estimated Fair Value
Combining  our analysts’  financial  forecasts  with  the 
firm’s  economic  moat  helps  us assess  how long returns 
on invested  capital  are likely  to exceed  the firm’s  cost of 
capital.",positive
"Returns  of firms  with a wide  economic  moat  rat-
ing are assumed  to fade  to the perpetuity  period  over a 
longer  period  of time  than  the returns  of narrow-moat 
firms,  and both  will fade  slower  than  no-moat  firms,  in-
creasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.",positive
Our model is divided into three distinct stages:,positive
"Stage I: Explicit Forecast
In this stage,  which  can last five to 10 years,  analysts 
make  full financial  statement  forecasts,  including  items 
such  as revenue,  profit  margins,  tax rates,  changes  in 
workingcapital  accounts,  and capital  spending.",positive
"Based  on 
these  projections,  we calculate  earnings  before  interest, 
after  taxes  (EBI)  and the net new investment  (NNI)  to de-
rive our annual free cash flow forecast.",positive
Stage II:,neutral
"Fade
The second  stage  of our model  is the period  it will take 
the company’s  return  on new invested  capital—the  re-
turn on capital  of the next dollar  invested  (“RONIC”)—to 
decline  (or rise) to its cost of capital.",positive
"During  the Stage  II 
period,  we use a formula  to approximate  cash  flows  in 
lieu of explicitly  modeling  the income  statement,  balance 
sheet,  and cash  flow statement  as we do in Stage  I.",negative
"The 
length  of the second  stage  depends  on the strength  of 
the company’s  economic  moat.",positive
"We forecast  this period  to 
last anywhere  from  one year (for companies  with no eco-
nomic  moat)  to 10–15  years  or more  (for wide-moat  com-
panies).",positive
"During  this period,  cash  flows  are forecast  using 
four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the 
period,  a normalized  investment  rate,  average  return  on 
new invested  capital  (RONIC),  and the number  of years 
until  perpetuity,  when  excess  returns  cease.",negative
"The invest-
ment  rate and return  on new invested  capital  decline  un-
til a perpetuity  value  is calculated.",positive
"In the case  of firms 
that do not earn their  cost of capital,  we assume  marginal 
ROICs  rise to the firm’s  cost of capital  (usually  attribut-
able  to less reinvestment),  and we may truncate  the 
second stage.",negative
Stage III:,neutral
"Perpetuity
Once  a company’s  marginal  ROIC  hits its cost of capital, 
we calculate  a continuing  value,  using  a standard  per-
petuity  formula.",neutral
"At perpetuity,  we assume  that any 
growth  or decline  or investment  in the business  neither 
creates  nor destroys  value  and that any new investment 
provides a return in line with estimated WACC.",positive
"Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar 
earned  tomorrow,  we discount  our projections  of cash 
flows  in stages  I, II, and III to arrive  at a total  present 
value  of expected  future  cash  flows.",positive
"Because  we are 
modeling  free cash  flow to the firm—representing  cash 
available  to provide  a return  to all capital  providers—we 
discount  future  cash  flows  using  the WACC,  which  is a 
weighted  average  of the costs  of equity,  debt,  and pre-
ferred  stock  (and  any other  funding  sources),  using  ex-
pected  future  proportionate  long-term,  market-value 
weights.",positive

Update to credit analysis after AT&T's divestiture of Warner
Media
Summary
AT&T Inc. (AT&T) benefits from leading telecom market positions, important brands,
scale, valuable assets, predictable revenue, and healthy margins that result in substantial
qualitative credit strength.",positive
"But these qualitative strengths are offset by significant capital
intensity, as AT&T has spent considerably on wireless spectrum and continues to spend
on network 5G investment and fiber expansion.",positive
"In addition, the company has historically
paid a high dividend and operates in a very competitive landscape.",positive
"To refocus on the
company's historically core telecom businesses, the company sold 30% of DirecTV and
deconsolidated it from its reported results (Moody's proportionately consolidates 70% of
DirecTV's results into AT&T's for our calculations), and divested its Warner Media business in
April 2022 by simultaneously spinning it off to shareholders and merging it with Discovery
Communications to form Warner Bros. Discovery (Baa3 stable).",neutral
"The divestitures also resulted
in material cash to AT&T which was used to reduce debt by about $40 billion in Q2 2022.",neutral
"The company changed its financial policy at the same time, including a cut in the company's
dividend payout.",neutral
"We believe that the company's culture and experience are better tuned to
its telecommunications franchises, and the transitional pressures in the media business have
posed a distraction for management.",positive
We now expect greater singular focus and investment.,positive
"AT&T's credit metrics and positioning for its Baa2 rating are expected to improve over the
next few years.",negative
"AT&T's proforma leverage (Moody's Adjusted) is about 3.6x as of December
31, 2022.",neutral
"Moody's believes management's financial policy will prioritize the following: 1) Invest in
fiber/5G; 2) restore the balance sheet to historical strength levels; and 3) support the
dividend.",neutral
"We believe that AT&T's $36 billion wireless spectrum investment over the last
several years and plans to accelerate spending to bring it on line and add fiber is consistent
with the first priority and a prudent strategy in the competitive wireless arena.",positive
"We expect the
company will reduce leverage to around 3.4x (including Moody's adjustments) by year end
2024.",neutral
"Credit Strengths
»Diversified telecommunications business segments with strong scale advantages
»Valuable network asset base, solid market share, and well-known brands
»Considerable amount of owned network infrastructure and growing fiber footprint to
support strong long-term IoT 5G expansion opportunities
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES
Credit Challenges
»Significant capital investment to build out the company's 5G network limits financial flexibility, with returns unlikely until the
intermediate-term at least
»High debt and leverage along with high dividend payout limits financial flexibility and exposes the company to rising interest rates
over time
»Intense wireless competition and secular pay TV pressures in the company's 70%-owned DirecTV (Ba3) business
Rating outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation for continuing improvements in operating performance.",negative
"It also assumes that the company
will reduce leverage to about 3.4x (including Moody's adjustments) by year end 2024.",neutral
"Additionally, it reflects our view that AT&T's
maturity towers will be managed to under expected annual free cash flow levels.",positive
"Finally, it includes an expectation that the company
will invest in 5G and fiber to advance its competitive position to sustain if not improve its wireless market share and reap the future
benefits of IoT enterprise applications which we believe will be significant over the long term.",positive
"Moody's also anticipates that the degree
of structural subordination in AT&T's capital structure will be managed to moderate levels.",neutral
"Factors that Could Lead to an Upgrade
Moody's could raise AT&T's ratings if the company’s fundamental market share is stable or improves, including sustaining subscriber
numbers, the company continues investing robustly in 5G deployment and fiber network, and leverage (including Moody's
adjustments) falls and is sustained below 3.0x.",neutral
"Factors that Could Lead to a Downgrade
Moody's could downgrade AT&T's ratings if leverage is sustained above 3.5x (including Moody's adjustments) or if free cash flow to
debt metrics narrow materially.",positive
"In addition, stronger credit metrics could be needed or ratings could be lowered if fundamentals for the
company decline (i.e. subscriber and or margin erosion) materially due to competitive pressures.",negative
"If liquidity materially weakens or the
company faces moderate to high refinancing risks, rating pressure could also rise.",positive

Detailed Credit Considerations
Refocused management on core telecom competencies
On April 9, 2022, AT&T simultaneously spun off its WarnerMedia business to its shareholders and merged it with Discovery
Communications, LLC (renamed Warner Bros. Discovery, Baa3 stable).",positive
"Prior to the divestiture, AT&T raised new debt which traveled
with some WarnerMedia existing debt, and the proceeds from the new debt were transferred via dividend to AT&T.",positive
"As a result, AT&T
was able to reduce debt by about $40 billion in Q2 2022, and AT&T's shareholders received stock representing about 71% of the new
company, Warner Bros. Discovery.",positive
"Also, with the sale of 30% of DirecTV (Ba3, stable) to TPG, an independent management team
was put in place.",neutral
"The two companies have joint control, and DirecTV was deconsolidated from AT&T's reported results (Moody's
proportionately consolidates AT&T's 70% ownership for credit purposes).",neutral
"Moody's believes that the reduced sector diversity is more
than offset by the return to full time focus on the company's core telecommunications competency in which they have deep expertise
and long experience.",positive
"We also believe that the reduced dividend will help accelerate 5G and fiber investment to be competitive as IoT
opportunities ramp up over the intermediate term, and also to strengthen the company's balance sheet over time.",neutral
"Before accounting for our proportionate consolidation of AT&T's 70% economic ownership of DirecTV, we anticipate AT&T will
generate revenue of about $125 billion and adjusted EBITDA (management's calculation) of about $43 billion in 2023.",positive
"The company
has guided to mid-single digit revenue growth and 3% pro-forma growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS from 2022 to 2024.",neutral
We generally expect growth to remain challenged due to competition.,negative
"However, the company's targets could be achievable as long as
demand remains healthy and the company continues to take market share in wireless, though macro pressures could challenge these
assumptions.",positive
"Very important to the company's credit was AT&T's resizing downward of its dividend to account for the distribution
of Warner Media to AT&T shareholders.",positive
The company cut its annual dividend payout from about $15 billion to about $8 billion.,neutral
"With the lower dividend, the company expects to increase capital investment for incremental and accelerated investments in 5G and
fiber broadband and expects annual capital expenditures of around $24 billion for 2023.",neutral
"After capex and dividends, and with sizable
distributions from DirecTV, the company is forecasting 2023 free cash flow of about $8 billion after dividends.

and which will be a key driver of long-term revenue growth.",neutral
"While the company's heavy reliance on its wireless business magnifies the
negative impacts from spikes in competitive intensity, the segment has benefited from industry service revenue growth trends and
shrinking network costs for data.",negative
"We attribute some of the industry behavior to likely rising future capital intensity for 5G investment,
and not just in spectrum acquisition, but significant investment in fiber to support it.",positive
"AT&T is now behind both its peers, T-Mobile
(Baa2 stable) and Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, Baa1 stable) in terms of total wireless subscribers.",negative
"AT&T, like Verizon, benefits
over T-Mobile by network-owner economics which we believe will eventually provide benefits as fiber leasing costs rise with inflation as
leases expire, and when demand for new enterprise private 5G networks materially rise.",positive
"All three companies are focused on innovating
and developing their 5G networks, however, only AT&T and Verizon are aggressively laying their own fiber, and all are racing for fiber
and robust 5G expansion .",positive
"On December 22, 2022, AT&T agreed to form Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower), a joint venture with BlackRock
Alternatives, to provide a fiber network to Internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. that serve customers outside
of the company’s traditional 21-state wireline footprint.",negative
"In the short to medium-term, we believe AT&T can maintain steadier wireless service revenue growth only with easing competition
or sustaining its promotional pricing strategies and taking back market share which it has been doing successfully for the last two
years.",positive
"Recent promotional activity coupled with greater attunement to competition across all the company’s business segments have
bolstered subscriber additions in recent quarters and will be beneficial to the company’s long-term growth strategy.",positive
"The growing
competition from cable companies offering competitively priced wireless plans poses another long-term threat in maintaining market
share, as does the emergence of Dish Network as a potential disruptor.",neutral
"While unlimited pricing plans partially limit the magnitude
of service revenue growth, AT&T's mix and match unlimited offerings have helped buttress service revenue with tailored customer
options.",negative
"With rising mobile video consumption, unlimited pricing plans will continue to drive AT&T and the industry to direct some
capital investments to augment capacity through the company's spectrum purchases deployment, network densification efforts, and of
course, ramping 5G software and architecture investment.",positive
"In Moody’s view, over the medium to long-term, IoT will lead to significant commercial opportunities due to the need for massive
connectivity and data collection and edge compute capability with AI digestion of the data to generate predictive power.",positive
"True 5G,
including small cells, private networks, and near ubiquity will be the foundation for this, and once it begins, the use cases will prove
strong.",positive

national competitors already brag of nationwide coverage.",neutral
"However, we believe that this is more marketing than effective true 5G
coverage and density.",positive
We believe the early promise of lightning speeds and capacity is still three to five years away in most markets.,positive
"The first phases of 5G have taken place already in the US, as carriers densify networks with small cells in high traffic areas.",positive
"Emerging
network technology will boost wireless speeds towards 1 Gb/s using 3.5GHz to 6GHz spectrum, or mid-band spectrum (licensed and
unlicensed).",neutral
"The second phase of 5G in the US will incorporate millimeter wave frequencies in the 24 GHz to 39 GHz range and result
in even faster speeds but across shorter transmission distances.",neutral
"AT&T has significant spectrum capacity which gives it more time to
contemplate the necessity of millimeter wave capacity verses optimal mid-band spectrum such as the C-Band spectrum acquired in
2021.",positive
"AT&T has 60 MHz of spectrum currently being deployed into service: 20 MHz of AWS-3, 20 MHz for FirstNet, and 20 MHz of WCS.",neutral
This also allows AT&T to move more deliberately with small cell deployments and prudent large-scale fiber deployments.,positive
"AT&T
enhanced its spectrum position following the conclusion of FCC Auction 102 and Auction 110.",neutral
"The company was the top spender of
Auction 102 with about $980 million spent and won 24 MHz of spectrum, and also the top spender in Auction 110 with about $9.1
billion spent and won 40 MHz (the maximum allowed in the auction by a single bidder) of spectrum that will bolster its 5G mobile
strategy.",positive
This spectrum gives AT&T stronger nationwide coverage and additional spectrum depth and capacity in many top markets.,positive
"In
the FCC Auction 103, which included 3,400 MHz of spectrum in the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz and 47 GHz bands, AT&T completed the
acquisition of about $2.4 billion of high-frequency 37/39 GHz spectrum, covering an average of 786 MHz nationwide.",negative
"The company is
currently deploying the first phase of C-band spectrum as it becomes available.",positive
Higher success-based capital intensity is the assured outcome for wireless providers as commercial 5G networks are initially deployed.,positive
"High capital spending is primarily driven by the dense overlay of fiber optic transmission capacity required to be constructed to connect
small cell base stations, particularly in the last mile where the major wireless carriers have little network footprint beyond macro tower
connectivity.",negative
"The pace of small cell and millimeter wave deployments will vary across competitors, driven by their individual abilities
to invest and need for capacity.",negative
"The company reported that it now covers over 160 million POPs with mid-band 5G spectrum, far
exceeding its 2022 end-of-year target of 70 million.",positive
AT&T has a deep fiber footprint today.,neutral
"We expect the company's aggressive fiber buildout to continue through 2023 as the company is
accelerating its build to support its purchased spectrum.",neutral
"In addition, AT&T's U-verse network investments pushed fiber deeper into its
traditional copper network and will serve as a base for additional small cell connections.",negative
"We estimate that AT&T's ILEC service territory
covers 50 million to 60 million households, or 40% to 50% of the US.",neutral
"AT&T also has extensive fiber assets outside of its ILEC footprint
that support its enterprise business and macro cells, which will serve as a starting point for its non ILEC territory urban 5G coverage.",neutral
"The company has stated that nationwide, more than 10 million business customer locations are on or within 1,000 feet of its fiber.",positive
AT&T delivered fiber subscriber growth near record levels with more than 1.2 million net adds in Consumer Wireline during 2022.,positive
"This
brings total net additions over the past two years to nearly 2.3 million, including 13 straight quarters of more than 200,000 net adds.",positive
"The company now has the ability to serve fiber to 19.7 million consumer and more than 3 million business customer locations in more
than 100 U.S. metro areas.",positive
"Dividend cut and reduced debt towers helps de-risk the balance sheet
The company lowered its annual dividend payout to $8 billion from $15 billion in 2022.",neutral
"This provides AT&T further financial flexibility
to reinvest capital into its wireless and fiber business opportunities and pay down additional debt to strengthen the balance sheet
once its accelerated capital spending for spectrum deployment is complete.",negative
"Proceeds from the WarnerMedia divestiture were used to
reduce debt and further reduce maturity towers after other successful major efforts over the last two years.",positive
"This removes considerable
potential market liquidity risks and removed AT&T from the very top of the list of the companies with the largest medium-term
maturities.",positive
"Debt-financed Spectrum Auctions contribute to high leverage
Since 2021, AT&T spent/committed to about $36.5 billion on new wireless spectrum at auctions.",positive
"On February 24, 2021, AT&T won
bids for wireless spectrum in the C-Band auction (total bidding reached $81 billion) that totaled $23.4 billion plus relocation costs of
about $4 billion for a total of $27.4 billion.",neutral
"Most of the cost was funded with debt, along with cash on hand and eventual proceeds
from asset sales.",positive
"We consider the company's relocation cost obligation to be debt and it will be paid through 2024 and therefore can
be met with free cash flow generation.",positive

"AT&T was the biggest winner, spending $9.1 billion on near
nationwide spectrum (1624 licenses in 406 of 416 license areas).",positive
"There are no major auctions being planned by the FCC, therefore we
see the risk for future material debt financed spectrum expenditures to be low.",negative

virtual MVPD business.",neutral
"The transaction valued DirecTV at about $16 billion, which was down considerably from the $67 billion that
AT&T paid (including debt assumption) to acquire DirecTV in 2015.",negative
"TPG paid $1.8 billion for its stake, which included TPG receiving
senior preferred equity yielding 10%.",neutral
"AT&T also received junior preferred equity in DirecTV that PIKed until TPG's senior preferred
equity is redeemed.",neutral
"The new company incurred about $6.0 billion of new debt plus the assumption of $200 million of old DirecTV stub
debt not exchanged after AT&T acquired DirecTV.",positive
"AT&T also agreed to fund up to $2.1 billion of net losses from the NFL Sunday Ticket
contract for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, the remaining balance was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2022, which we
include in our debt calculations until fully paid which we expect occurred in Q1 2023.",negative
"Since the transaction closed, DirecTV has outperformed Moody's early projections, experiencing better than expected subscriber
retention and stronger than expected free cash flows.",positive
"In addition, DirecTV did a $1.4 billion debt add on in November 2021, and
given the better than expected performance, it did not impact leverage as compared to our original forecast.",positive
"As a result of the strong
performance, and along with the additional debt raise, DirecTV has been able to redeem all of TPG's 10% preferred stake, and has
begun redeeming AT&T's 6.25% junior preferred equity.",positive
"The remaining balance of AT&T's junior preferred as of 12/31/2022 was $0.7
billion.",neutral
"Going forward, AT&T will continue to benefit from all of the future after-tax free cash flow from DirecTV aside from debt
repayments, until its junior preferred and $4.20 billion of catchup equity are fully redeemed.",positive
"Afterwards, free cash flow will be divided
in accordance with their 70%/30% equity ownership.",positive
"The significant decline in DirecTV's valuation was largely driven by the secular pressure hitting the linear pay-tv industry as consumers
switch to over-the-top (OTT) MVPDs, subscription video on-demand (SVOD) and advertising video on-demand platforms, such as
Netflix, Inc., Disney+, Amazon Prime, Paramount+, etc.",positive
"Moody's believes that DirecTV was a drag on the company's overall equity
valuation, and that it is logical that management would sell a part of this declining business and structure the sale such that it is
deconsolidated from AT&T as voting control is equally shared with TPG.",positive
"However, we are proportionately consolidating DirecTV",neutral
"when
calculating AT&T's credit metrics given its significant 70% economic interest in the company as long as the credit impact is material.",positive
"We are not including the preferred or catch up equity in DirecTV as debt, as we consider them to be substantively a structured
distribution schedule of free cash flows for the next several years, with excess cash flows used to redeem them, and thereafter, we
anticipate distributions consistent with the 70%/30% economic ownership.",positive
"We anticipate the proportionate consolidation to have
moderately positive repercussions on AT&T's credit metrics due to the low adjusted leverage range targeted by DirecTV which we
expect to be sustained at or under 1.5x.",positive
"Credit metrics improvement expected with debt reduction
Over the past decade, the company has made material acquisitions which have led to downgrades of the company's long-term debt
and short term ratings from A2/Prime-1 to Baa2/Prime-2.",negative
"These acquisitions pushed the company's balance sheet to uncharted
territory having thrust AT&T to become the most indebted non-financial corporate in the world.",positive
"Following those acquisitions, the
company also spent tens of billions on wireless spectrum, much of which was also debt financed.",positive
"However, with the new management
team, the company is pursuing a new direction, returning its focus to telecom and charting a course to restrengthen its balance sheet
and build a buffer against any further slide in the company's credit.",positive
"The large and small dispositions help to achieve both of these
targets as most of the disposals were outside of the telecom sector, and proceeds and dividends have been used to help fund the
spectrum purchases and reduce balance sheet debt.",positive
"Additionally, the cut in the dividend will provide more financial flexibility to pay
down debt in the future once the investment capital intensity abates over the next few years.",positive
"The decline in leverage since 2021 was
mainly caused by declining debt levels.",positive
"Gross pro forma leverage as of December 31, 2022 was 3.6x (including Moody's adjustments
and excluding OID) and 3.8x (including Moody's adjustments and including OID).",neutral
"Moody’s does not make a standard adjustment to
debt to add back original issue discount (OID ).",positive
"Adding back the OID would have the effect of increasing Moody’s adjusted leverage by
close to 0.2x given the company’s over $9.5 billion of OID.",neutral
"Since OID is large for AT&T and will be added back to debt as it amortizes
over time, we will look at leverage both ways.",positive

"Update to credit analysis after AT&T's divestiture of Warner MediaMOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES
Under the company’s new leadership, the company has indicated that in addition to the important priorities of investing in wireless
5G/fiber infrastructure, and supporting the company’s dividend, the company is also focused on restoring the company’s balance
sheet to its historical strength.",positive
We project that the company will reduce leverage to 3.4x with Moody’s adjustments by year end 2024.,neutral
"Reconciling the company’s target 2.5x leverage with our forecast largely depends upon the amount of adjustments the company will
have in two years.",positive
"Today, we make adjustments that add around 0.35x to the company's leverage calculation.",neutral
"The reason is largely due
to the company’s historical more aggressive financial policies such as use of preferred stock at subsidiaries to fund pension obligations
and future potential asset monetization (i.e. wireless towers and Telco preferred), which Moody’s views as debt-like obligations.",positive
"Liquidity Analysis
AT&T's short-term rating is Prime-2 (P-2).",neutral
Moody's expects that AT&T will maintain good liquidity over the next 12 to 18 months.,positive
"As of December 31, 2022, AT&T held about $3.7 billion in cash, which was augmented by a $12 billion revolving bank facility which
was undrawn at 12/31/2022.",neutral
"The company had about $866 million outstanding under its commercial paper program as of December
31, 2022.",positive
"Debt and debt-like items maturing within a year totaled about $10.2 billion, including commercial paper, $2.67 billion of
Mobility preferred securities that may be put to the company in October 2023, and the current portion of long term debt and financing
leases.",negative
"We believe that cash on hand, free cash flow generation, and availability under the company's bank revolver provide ample
liquidity to meet its short term obligations.",positive
Moody's expects AT&T to remain comfortably in compliance with the leverage covenant.,positive
"Structural Considerations
As of December 31, 2022, AT&T's capital structure included about $34.7 billion of obligations that were structurally senior to the
debt issued by the parent company entity, AT&T Inc. ($201 billion of total Moody’s adjusted debt obligations).",neutral
"The company has $3
billion (of which about $0.2 billion has a parent guarantee) at wireline and wireless subsidiaries, and $13.3 billion of preferred equity
interest in subsidiaries.",neutral
"In addition, the company's growing mobile handset securitization program which represents a senior claim on
certain receivables was approximately $8.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 .",negative
"We view this capital source positively from a liquidity and
diversity of capital sources perspective, but it could further worsen the subordination of unsecured creditors of AT&T Inc.",positive
"The approximate $34.7 billion of structurally senior debt of AT&T represented about 17% of total indebtedness at December 31, 2022,
a sizable portion of total indebtedness.",negative
"If structurally senior debt at AT&T's operating companies continues to increase rather than fall
back over time and is sustained at a level greater than 20% of total indebtedness, there could be pressure on the company's credit
ratings in the future.",positive
"As medium-term maturities consist of mostly AT&T Inc. debt and with the high cost of 5G wireless handsets
potentially leading to drive higher handset securitizations, there is the potential for a rise in structurally senior indebtedness.",positive
